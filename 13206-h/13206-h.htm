<h2><a name="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<br>
<p>The aim of this volume is to sketch the history of the monastic
institution from its origin to its overthrow in the Reformation
period, for although the institution is by no means now extinct,
its power was practically broken in the sixteenth century, and no
new orders of importance or new types have arisen since that
time.</p>
<p>A little reflection will enable one to understand the great
difficulties in the execution of so broad a purpose. It was
impracticable in the majority of instances to consult original
sources, although intermediate authorities have been studied as
widely as possible and the greatest caution has been exercised to
avoid those errors which naturally arise from the use of such
avenues of information. It was also deemed unadvisable to burden
the work with numerous notes and citations. Such notes as were
necessary to a true unfolding of the subject will be found in the
appendix.</p>
<p>A presentation of the salient features of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> whole history was
essential to a proper conception of the orderly development of the
ascetic ideal. To understand the monastic institution one must not
only study the isolated anchorite seeking a victory over a sinful
self in the Egyptian desert or the monk in the secluded cloister,
but he must also trace the fortunes of ascetic organizations,
involving multitudes of men, vast aggregations of wealth, and
surviving the rise and fall of empires. Almost every phase of human
life is encountered in such an undertaking. Attention is divided
between hermits, beggars, diplomatists, statesmen, professors,
missionaries and pontiffs. It is hoped the critical or literary
student will appreciate the immense difficulties of an attempt to
paint so vast a scene on so small a canvas. No other claim is made
upon his benevolence.</p>
<p>There is a process of writing history which Trench describes as
"a moral whitewashing of such things as in men's sight were as
blackamoors before." Religious or temperamental prejudice often
obscures the vision and warps the judgment of even the most
scholarly minds. Conscious of this infirmity in the ablest writers
of history it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[pg
7]</span> would be absurd to claim complete exemption from the
power of personal bias. It is sincerely hoped, however, that the
strongest passion in the preparation of this work has been that
commendable predilection for truth and justice which should
characterize every historical narrative, and that, whatever other
shortcomings may be found herein, there is an absence of that
unreasonable suspicion, not to say hatred, of everything monastic,
which mars many otherwise valuable contributions to monastic
history.</p>

<h2>LIST OF PORTRAITS</h2>
<blockquote>SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI, DYING, is CONVEYED TO THE<br>
CHURCH OF SAINTE MARIE DE PORTIUNCULE, . . . . <i>facing
title</i>.<br>
<br>
After the painting by J.J. Weerts. Originally published by<br>
Goupil &amp; Co. of Paris, and here reproduced by their
permission.<br>
<br>
[Jean Joseph Weerts was born at Roubaix (Nord), on May 1, 1847. He
was a pupil of<br>
Cabanel, Mils and Pils. He was awarded the second-class medal in
1875, was made<br>
Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1884, received the silver medal
at the Universal<br>
Exposition of 1889, and was created an Officer of the Legion of
Honor in 1897. He is a<br>
member of the "Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Artistes Fran&ccedil;ais,"
and is <i>hors concours</i>.]<br>
<br>
<a href="#image193.jpg">SAINT BERNARD</a><br>
<br>
After an engraving by Ambroise Tardieu, from a painting on
glass<br>
in the Convent of the R.P. Minimes, at Rheims.<br>
<br>
[Ambroise Tardieu was born in Paris, in 1790, and died in 1837. He
was an engraver<br>
of portraits, landscapes and architecture, and a clever manipulator
of the burin. For a<br>
time he held the position of "Geographical Engraver" to the
Departments of Marine,<br>
Fortifications and Forests. He was a member of the French
Geographical and Mathematical<br>
Societies.]--<i>Nagler</i>.<br>
<br>
<a href="#image232.jpg">SAINT DOMINIC</a><br>
<br>
From a photograph of Bozzani's painting, preserved in his cell
at<br>
Santa Sabina, Rome. Here reproduced from Augusta T. Drane's<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> "History
of St. Dominic," by courtesy of the author and the publishers,<br>
Longmans, Green &amp; Co., of London and New York.<br>
<br>
["Although several so-called portraits (of St. Dominic) are
preserved, yet none of them<br>
can be regarded as the <i>vera effigies</i> of the saint, though
that preserved at Santa Sabina<br>
probably presents us with a kind of traditionary
likeness."]--<i>History of St. Dominic</i>.<br>
<br>
[In the "History of St. Dominic," on page 226, the author credits
the portrait shown<br>
to "Bozzani." We are unable to find any record of a painter by that
name. Nagler,<br>
however, tells of a painter of portraits and historical subjects,
Carlo Bozzoni by name,<br>
who was born in 1607 and died in 1657. He was a son of Luciano
Bozzoni, a Genoese<br>
painter and engraver. He is said to have done good work, but no
other mention is made<br>
of him.]<br>
<br>
<a href="#image263.jpg">IGNATIUS DE LOYOLA</a><br>
<br>
After the engraving by Greatbach, "from a scarce print by H.<br>
Wierz." Originally published by Richard Bentley, London, in
1842.<br>
<br>
[W. Greatbach was a London engraver in the first half of the
nineteenth century. He<br>
worked chiefly for the "calendars" and "annuals" of his time, and
did notable work<br>
for the general book trade of the better class.]<br>
<br>
[A search of the authorities does not reveal an engraver named "H.
Wierz." This<br>
is probably intended for Hieronymus Wierex (or Wierix, according to
Bryant), a famous<br>
engraver, born in 1552, and who is credited by Nagler, in his
"K&uuml;nstler-Lexikon,"<br>
with having produced "a beautiful and rare plate" of "St. Ignaz von
Loyola." The<br>
error, if such it be, is easily explained by the fact that portrait
engravers seldom cut the<br>
lettering of a plate themselves, but have it engraved by others,
who have a special aptitude<br>
for making shapely letters.]</blockquote>

<h2>AND MONASTERIES</h2>

<h2><i><a name="MONASTICISM_IN_THE_EAST"></a>MONASTICISM IN THE
EAST</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The monk is a type of religious character by no means peculiar
to Christianity. Every great religion in ancient and modern times
has expressed itself in some form of monastic life.</p>
<p>The origin of the institution is lost in antiquity. Its genesis
and gradual progress through the centuries are like the movement of
a mighty river springing from obscure sources, but gathering volume
by the contributions of a multitude of springs, brooks, and lesser
rivers, entering the main stream at various stages in its progress.
While the mysterious source of the monastic stream may not be
found, it is easy to discover many different <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> influences and causes
that tended to keep the mighty current flowing majestically on. It
is not so easy to determine which of these forces was the
greatest.</p>
<p>"Monasticism," says Schaff, "proceeds from religious
seriousness, enthusiasm and ambition; from a sense of the vanity of
the world, and an inclination of noble souls toward solitude,
contemplation, and freedom from the bonds of the flesh and the
temptations of the world." A strong ascetic tendency in human
nature, particularly active in the Orient, undoubtedly explains in
a general way the origin and growth of the institution. Various
forms of philosophy and religious belief fostered this monastic
inclination from time to time by imparting fresh impetus to the
desire for soul-purity or by deepening the sense of disgust with
the world.</p>
<p>India is thought by some to have been the birthplace of the
institution. In the sacred writings of the venerable Hind&ucirc;s,
portions of which have been dated as far back as 2400 B.C., there
are numerous legends about holy monks and many ascetic rules.
Although based on opposite philosophical <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> principles, the
earlier Brahminism and the later system, Buddhism, each tended
toward ascetic practices, and they each boast to-day of long lines
of monks and nuns.</p>
<p>The Hindoo (Brahmin) ascetic, or naked philosopher, as the
Greeks called him, exhausted his imagination in devising schemes of
self-torture. He buried himself with his nose just above the
ground, or wore an iron collar, or suspended weights from his body.
He clenched his fists until the nails grew into his palms, or kept
his head turned in one direction until he was unable to turn it
back. He was a miracle-worker, an oracle of wisdom, and an honored
saint. He was bold, spiritually proud, capable of almost superhuman
endurance. We will meet him again in the person of his Christian
descendant on the banks of the Nile.</p>
<p>The Buddhist ascetic was, perhaps, less severe with himself, but
the general spirit and form of the institution was and is the same
as among the Brahmins. In each religion we observe the same selfish
individualism,--a desire to save one's own soul by slavish
obedience to ascetic rules,--the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> extinction of natural desires by
self-punishment. "A Brahmin who wishes to become an ascetic," says
Clarke, "must abandon his home and family and go live in the
forest. His food must be roots and fruit, his clothing a bark
garment or a skin, he must bathe morning and evening, and suffer
his hair to grow."</p>
<p>The fact to be remembered, however, is that in India, centuries
before the Christian Era, there existed both phases of Christian
monasticism, the hermit[<a href="#NOTE_A">A</a>] and the crowded
convent.</p>
<p>Dhaquit, a Chaldean ascetic, who is said to have lived about
2000 B.C., is reported to have earnestly rebuked those who tried to
preserve the body from decay by artificial resources. "Not by
natural means," he said, "can man preserve his body from corruption
and dissolution after death, but only through good deeds, religious
exercises and offering of sacrifices,--by invoking the gods by
their great and beautiful names, by prayers during the night, and
fasts during the day."</p>
<p>When Father Bury, a Portuguese missionary, first saw the Chinese
bonzes, tonsured and using <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> their rosaries, he cried out, "There is
not a single article of dress, or a sacerdotal function, or a
single ceremony of the Romish church, which the Devil has not
imitated in this country." I have not the courage to follow this
streamlet back into the devil's heart. The attempt would be too
daring. Who invented shaved heads and monkish gowns and habits, we
cannot tell, but this we know: long before Father Bury saw and
described those things in China, there existed in India the Grand
Lama or head monk, with monasteries under him, filled with monks
who kept the three vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. They
had their routine of prayers, of fasts and of labors, like the
Christian monks of the middle ages.</p>
<p>Among the Greeks there were many philosophers who taught ascetic
principles. Pythagoras, born about 580 B.C., established a
religious brotherhood in which he sought to realize a high ideal of
friendship. His whole plan singularly suggests monasticism. His
rules provided for a rigid self-examination and unquestioning
submission to a master. Many authorities claim that the influence
of the Pythagorean philosophy was <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> strongly felt in Egypt and Palestine,
after the time of Christ. "Certain it is that more than two
thousand years before Ignatius Loyola assembled the nucleus of his
great society in his subterranean chapel in the city of Paris,
there was founded at Crotona, in Greece, an order of monks whose
principles, constitution, aims, method and final end entitle them
to be called 'The Pagan Jesuits[<a href="#NOTE_B">B</a>].'"</p>
<p>The teachings of Plato, no doubt, had a powerful monastic
influence, under certain social conditions, upon later thinkers and
upon those who yearned for victory over the flesh. Plato strongly
insisted on an ideal life in which higher pleasures are preferred
to lower. Earthly thoughts and ambitions are to yield before a holy
communion with the Divine. Some of his views "might seem like
broken visions of the future, when we think of the first disciples
who had all things in common, and, in later days, of the celibate
clergy, and the cloisteral life of the religious orders." The
effect of such philosophy in times of general corruption upon those
who wished to acquire exceptional moral <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> and intellectual
power, and who felt unable to cope with the temptations of social
life, may be easily imagined. It meant, in many cases, a retreat
from the world to a life of meditation and soul-conflict. In later
times it exercised a marked influence upon ascetic literature.</p>
<p>Coming closer to Christianity in time and in teaching, we find a
Jewish sect, called Essenes, living in the region of the Dead Sea,
which bore remarkable resemblances to Christian monasticism. The
origin and development of this band, which numbered four thousand
about the time of Christ, are unknown. Even the derivation of the
name is in doubt, there being at least twenty proposed
explanations. The sect is described by Philo, an Alexandrian-Jewish
philosopher, who was born about 25 B.C., and by Josephus, the
Jewish historian, who was born at Jerusalem A.D. 37. These writers
evidently took pains to secure the facts, and from their accounts,
upon which modern discussions of the subject are largely based, the
following facts are gleaned.</p>
<p>The Essenes were a sect outside the Jewish ecclesiastical body,
bound by strict vows and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> professing an extraordinary purity.
While there were no vows of extreme penance, they avoided cities as
centers of immorality, and, with some exceptions, eschewed
marriage. They held aloof from traffic, oaths, slave-holding, and
weapons of offence. They were strict Sabbath observers, wore a
uniform robe, possessed all things in common, engaged in manual
labor, abstained from forbidden food, and probably rejected the
bloody sacrifices of the Temple, although continuing to send their
thank-offerings. Novitiates were kept on probation three years. The
strictest discipline was maintained, excommunication following
detection in heinous sins. Evidently the standard of character was
pure and lofty, since their emphasis on self-mastery did not end in
absurd extravagances. Their frugal food, simple habits, and love of
cleanliness; combined with a regard for ethical principles,
conduced to a high type of life. Edersheim remarks, "We can
scarcely wonder that such Jews as Josephus and Philo, and such
heathens as Pliny, were attracted by such an unworldly and lofty
sect."</p>
<p>Some writers maintain that they were also worshipers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> of the
sun, and hence that their origin is to be traced to Persian
sources. Even if so, they seemed to have escaped that confused and
mystical philosophy which has robbed Oriental thought of much power
in the realm of practical life. Philo says, "Of philosophy, the
dialectical department, as being in no wise necessary for the
acquisition of virtue, they abandon to the word-catchers; and the
part which treats of the nature of things, as being beyond human
nature, they leave to speculative air-gazers, with the exception of
that part of it which deals with the subsistance of God and the
genesis of all things; but the ethical they right well work
out."</p>
<p>Pliny the elder, who lived A.D. 23-79, made the following
reference to the Essenes, which is especially interesting because
of the tone of sadness and weariness with the world suggested in
its praise of this Jewish sect. "On the western shore (of the Dead
Sea) but distant from the sea far enough to escape from its noxious
breezes, dwelt the Essenes. They are an eremite clan, one marvelous
beyond all others in the whole world; without any women, with
sexual intercourse entirely given up, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> without money, and
the associates of palm trees. Daily is the throng of those that
crowd about them renewed, men resorting to them in numbers, driven
through weariness of existence, and the surges of ill-fortune, to
their manner of life. Thus it is that through thousands of
ages--incredible to relate!--their society, in which no one is
born, lives on perennial. So fruitful to them is the irksomeness of
life experienced by other men."</p>
<p>Admission to the order was granted only to adults, yet children
were sometimes adopted for training in the principles of the sect.
Some believed in marriage as a means of perpetuating the order.</p>
<p>Since it would not throw light on our present inquiry, the
mooted question as to the connection of Essenism and the teachings
of Jesus may be passed by. The differences are as great as the
resemblances and the weight of opinion is against any vital
relation.</p>
<p>The character of this sect conclusively shows that some of the
elements of Christian monasticism existed in the time of Jesus, not
only in Palestine but in other countries. In an account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
Therapeut&aelig;, or true devotees, an ascetic body similar to the
Essenes, Philo says, "There are many parts of the world in which
this class may be found.... They are, however, in greatest
abundance in Egypt."</p>
<p>During Apostolic times various teachings and practices were
current that may be characterized as ascetic. The Apostle Paul, in
his letter to the Colossians, doubtless had in mind a sect or
school which despised the body and abstained from meats and wine. A
false asceticism, gathering inspiration from pagan philosophy, was
rapidly spreading among Christians even at that early day. The
teachings of the Gnostics, a speculative sect of many schools,
became prominent in the closing days of the Apostolic age or very
soon thereafter. Many of these schools claimed a place in the
church, and professed a higher life and knowledge than ordinary
Christians possessed. The Gnostics believed in the complete
subjugation of the body by austere treatment.</p>
<p>The Montanists, so called after Montanus, their famous leader,
arose in Asia Minor during the second century, when Marcus Aurelius
was emperor. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>[pg
28]</span> Schaff describes the movement as "a morbid exaggeration
of Christian ideas and demands." It was a powerful and frantic
protest against the growing laxity of the church. It despised
ornamental dress and prescribed numerous fasts and severities.</p>
<p>These facts and many others that might be mentioned throw light
on our inquiry in several ways. They show that asceticism was in
the air. The literature, philosophy and religion of the day drifted
toward an ascetic scheme of life and stimulated the tendency to
acquire holiness, even at the cost of innocent joys and natural
gratifications. They show that worldliness was advancing in the
church, which called for rebuke and a return to Apostolic
Christianity; that the church was failing to satisfy the highest
cravings of the soul. True, it was well-nigh impossible for the
church, in the midst of such a powerful and corrupt heathen
environment, to keep itself up to its standards.</p>
<p>It is a common tradition that in the first three centuries the
practices and spirit of the church were comparatively pure and
elevated. Harnack says, "This tradition is false. The church was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> already
secularized to a great extent in the middle of the third century."
She was "no longer in a position to give peace to all sorts and
conditions of men." It was then that the great exodus of Christians
from the villages and cities to mountains and deserts began.
Although from the time of Christ on there were always some who
understood Christianity to demand complete separation from all
earthly pleasures, yet it was three hundred years and more before
large numbers began to adopt a hermit's life as the only method of
attaining salvation. "They fled not only from the world, but from
the world within the church. Nevertheless, they did not flee out of
the church."</p>
<p>We can now see why no definite cause for the monastic
institution can be given and no date assigned for its origin. It
did not commence at any fixed time and definite place. Various
philosophies and religious customs traveled for centuries from
country to country, resulting in singular resemblances and
differences between different ascetic or monastic sects. Christian
monasticism was slowly evolved, and gradually assumed definite
organization <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[pg
30]</span> as a product of a curious medley of
Heathen-Jewish-Christian influences.</p>
<p>A few words should be said here concerning the influence of the
Bible upon monasticism. Naturally the Christian hermits and early
fathers appealed to the Bible in support of their teachings and
practices. It is not necessary, at this point, to discuss the
correctness of their interpretations. The simple fact is that many
passages of scripture were considered as commands to attain
perfection by extraordinary sacrifices, and certain Biblical
characters were reverenced as shining monastic models. In the light
of the difficulties of Biblical criticism it is easy to forgive
them if they were mistaken, a question to be discussed farther on.
They read of those Jewish prophets described in Hebrews: "They went
about in sheepskins, in goatskins; ... wandering in deserts and
mountains and caves, and the holes of the earth." They pointed to
Elijah and his school of prophets; to John the Baptist, with his
raiment of camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins,
whose meat was locusts and wild honey. They recalled the
commandment of Jesus to the rich <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> young man to sell all his possessions
and give to the poor. They quoted the words, "Take no thought for
the morrow what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink or wherewithal
ye shall be clothed." They construed following Christ to mean in
His own words, "forsaking father, mother, brethren, wife, children,
houses and lands." They pointed triumphantly to the Master himself,
unmarried and poor, who had not "where to lay his head." They
appealed to Paul's doctrine of marriage. They remembered that the
Church at Jerusalem was composed of those who sold their
possessions and had all things in common. Whatever these and
numerous other passages may truly mean, they interpreted them in
favor of a monastic mode of life; they understood them to teach
isolation, fastings, severities, and other forms of rigorous
self-denial. Accepting Scripture in this sense, they trampled upon
human affection and gave away their property, that they might
please God and save their souls.</p>
<p>Between the time of Christ and Paul of Thebes, who died in the
first half of the fourth century, and who is usually recognized as
the founder of monasticism, many Christian disciples voluntarily
abandoned <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
their wealth, renounced marriage and adopted an ascetic mode of
life, while still living in or near the villages or cities. As the
corruption of society and the despair of men became more
widespread, these anxious Christians wandered farther and farther
away from fixed habitations until, in an excess of spiritual
fervor, they found themselves in the caves of the mountains,
desolate and dreary, where no sound of human voice broke in upon
the silence. The companions of wild beasts, they lived in rapt
contemplation on the eternal mysteries of this most strange
world.</p>
<p>My task now is to describe some of those recluses who still live
in the biographies of the saints and the traditions of the church.
Ducis, while reading of these hermits, wrote to a friend as
follows: "I am now reading the lives of the Fathers of the Desert.
I am dwelling with St. Pachomius, the founder of the monastery at
Tabenna. Truly there is a charm in transporting one's self to that
land of the angels--one could not wish ever to come out of it."
Whether the reader will call these strange characters angels, and
will wish he could have shared their beds of stone and midnight
vigils, I will not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>[pg
33]</span> venture to say, but at all events his visit will be made
as pleasant as possible.</p>
<p>In writing the life of Mahomet, Carlyle said, "As there is no
danger of our becoming, any of us, Mahometans, I mean to say all
the good of Mahomet I justly can." So, without distorting the
picture that has come down to us, I mean to say all the good of
these Egyptian hermits that the facts will justify.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Hermits_of_Egypt"></a>The Hermits of
Egypt</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Egypt was the mother of Christian monasticism, as she has been
of many other wonders.</p>
<p>Vast solitudes; lonely mountains, honey-combed with dens and
caves; arid valleys and barren hills; dreary deserts that glistened
under the blinding glare of the sun that poured its heat upon them
steadily all the year; strange, grotesque rocks and peaks that
assumed all sorts of fantastic shapes to the overwrought fancy; in
many places no water, no verdure, and scarcely a thing in motion;
the crocodile and the bird lazily seeking their necessary food and
stirring only as compelled; unbounded expanse <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> in the wide star-lit
heavens; unbroken quiet on the lonely mountains--a fit home for the
hermit, a paradise to the lover of solitude and peace.</p>
<p>Of life under such conditions Kingsley has said: "They enjoyed
nature, not so much for her beauty as for her perfect peace. Day by
day the rocks remained the same. Silently out of the Eastern
desert, day by day, the rising sun threw aloft those arrows of
light which the old Greeks had named 'the rosy fingers of the
dawn.' Silently he passed in full blaze above their heads
throughout the day, and silently he dipped behind the Western
desert in a glory of crimson and orange, green and purple.... Day
after day, night after night, that gorgeous pageant passed over the
poor hermit's head without a sound, and though sun, moon and planet
might change their places as the years rolled round, the earth
beneath his feet seemed not to change." As for the companionless
men, who gazed for years upon this glorious scene, they too were of
unusual character, Waddington finely says: "The serious enthusiasm
of the natives of Egypt and Asia, that combination of indolence and
energy, of the calmest languor with the fiercest passions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> ...
disposed them to embrace with eagerness the tranquil but exciting
duties of religious seclusion." Yes, here are the angels of Ducis
in real flesh and blood. They revel in the wildest eccentricities
with none to molest or make afraid, always excepting the black
demons from the spiritual world. One dwells in a cave in the bowels
of the earth; one lies on the sand beneath a blazing sun; one has
shut himself forever from the sight of man in a miserable hut among
the bleak rocks of yonder projecting peak; one rests with joy in
the marshes, breathing with gratitude the pestilential vapors.</p>
<p>Some of these saints became famous for piety and miraculous
power. Athanasius, fleeing from persecution, visited them, and
Jerome sought them out to learn from their own lips the stories of
their lives. To these men and to others we are indebted for much of
our knowledge concerning this chapter of man's history. Less than
fifty years after Paul of Thebes died, or about 375 A.D., Jerome
wrote the story of his life, which Schaff justly characterizes as
"a pious romance." From Jerome we gather the following account:
Paul was the real founder of the hermit life, although not the
first to bear the name. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> During the Decian persecution, when
churches were laid waste and Christians were slain with barbarous
cruelty, Paul and his sister were bereaved of both their parents.
He was then a lad of sixteen, an inheritor of wealth and skilled
for one of his years in Greek and Egyptian learning. He was of a
gentle and loving disposition. On account of his riches he was
denounced as a Christian by an envious brother-in-law and compelled
to flee to the mountains in order to save his life. He took up his
abode in a cave shaded by a palm that afforded him food and
clothing. "And that no one may deem this impossible," affirms
Jerome, "I call to witness Jesus and his holy angels that I have
seen and still see in that part of the desert which lies between
Syria and the Saracens' country, monks of whom one was shut up for
thirty years and lived on barley bread and muddy water, while
another in an old cistern kept himself alive on five dried figs a
day."</p>
<p>It is impossible to determine how much of the story which
follows is historically true. Undoubtedly, it contains little
worthy of belief, but it gives us some faint idea of how these
hermits lived. Its chief value consists in the fact that it
preserves a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[pg
37]</span> fragment of the monastic literature of the times--a
story which was once accepted as a credible narrative. Imagine the
influence of such a tale, when believed to be true, upon a mind
inclined to embrace the doctrines of asceticism. Its power at that
time is not to be measured by its reliability now. Jerome himself
declares in the prologue that many incredible things were related
of Paul which he will not repeat. After reading the following
story, the reader may well inquire what more fanciful tale could be
produced even by a writer of fiction.</p>
<p>The blessed Paul was now one hundred and thirteen years old, and
Anthony, who dwelt in another place of solitude, was at the age of
ninety. In the stillness of the night it was revealed to Anthony
that deeper in the desert there was a better man than he, and that
he ought to see him. So, at the break of day, the venerable old
man, supporting and guiding his weak limbs with a staff, started
out, whither he knew not. At scorching noontide he beholds a
fellow-creature, half man, half horse, called by the poets
Hippo-centaur. After gnashing outlandish utterances, this monster,
in words broken, rather than spoken, through his bristling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> lips,
points out the way with his right hand and swiftly vanishes from
the hermit's sight. Anthony, amazed, proceeds thoughtfully on his
way when a mannikin, with hooked snout, horned forehead and goat's
feet, stands before him and offers him food. Anthony asks who he
is. The beast thus replies: "I am a mortal being, and one of those
inhabitants of the desert, whom the Gentiles deluded by various
forms of error worship, under the name of Fauns and Satyrs." As he
utters these and other words, tears stream down the aged traveler's
face! He rejoices over the glory of God and the destruction of
Satan. Striking the ground with his staff, he exclaims, "Woe to
thee, Alexandria, who, instead of God, worshipest monsters! Woe to
thee, harlot city, into which have flowed together the demons of
the world! What will you say now? Beasts speak of Christ, and you,
instead of God, worship monsters." "Let none scruple to believe
this incident," says the chronicler, "for a man of this kind was
brought alive to Alexandria and the people saw him; when he died
his body was preserved in salt and brought to Antioch that the
Emperor might view him."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
<p>Anthony continues to traverse the wild region into which he had
entered. There is no trace of human beings. The darkness of the
second night wears away in prayer. At day-break he beholds far away
a she-wolf gasping with parched thirst and creeping into a cave. He
draws near and peers within. All is dark, but perfect love casteth
out fear. With halting step and bated breath, he enters. After a
while a light gleams in the distant midnight darkness. With
eagerness he presses forward, but his foot strikes against a stone
and arouses the echoes; whereupon the blessed Paul closes the door
and makes it fast. For hours Anthony lay at the door craving
admission. "I know I am not worthy," he humbly cries, "yet unless I
see you I will not turn away. You welcome beasts, why not a man? If
I fail, I will die here on your threshold."</p>
<blockquote>"Such was his constant cry; unmoved he stood,<br>
To whom the hero thus brief answer made."</blockquote>
<p>"Prayers like these do not mean threats, there is no trickery in
tears." So, with smiles, Paul gives him entrance and the two aged
hermits fall into each <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> other's embrace. Together they converse
of things human and divine, Paul, close to the dust of the grave,
asks, Are new houses springing up in ancient cities? What
government directs the world? Little did this recluse know of his
fellow-beings and how fared it with the children of men who dwelt
in those great cities around the blue Mediterranean. He was dead to
the world and knew it no more.</p>
<p>A raven brought the aged brothers bread to eat and the hours
glided swiftly away. Anthony returned to get a cloak which
Athanasius had given him in which to wrap the body of Paul. So
eager was he to behold again his newly-found friend that he set out
without even a morsel of bread, thirsting to see him. But when yet
three days' journey from the cave he saw Paul on high among the
angels. Weeping, he trudged on his way. On entering the cave he saw
the lifeless body kneeling, with head erect and hands uplifted. He
tenderly wrapped the body in the cloak and began to lament that he
had no implements to dig a grave. But Providence sent two lions
from the recesses of the mountain that came rushing with flying
manes. Roaring, as if they too mourned, they pawed the earth and
thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> the
grave was dug. Anthony, bending his aged shoulders beneath the
burden of the saint's body, laid it lovingly in the grave and
departed.</p>
<p>Jerome closes this account by challenging those who do not know
the extent of their possessions,--who adorn their homes with marble
and who string house to house,--to say what this old man in his
nakedness ever lacked. "Your drinking vessels are of precious
stones; he satisfied his thirst with the hollow of his hand. Your
tunics are wrought of gold; he had not the raiment of your meanest
slave. But on the other hand, poor as he was, Paradise is open to
him; you, with all your gold, will be received into Gehenna. He,
though naked, yet kept the robe of Christ; you, clad in your silks,
have lost the vesture of Christ. Paul lies covered with worthless
dust, but will rise again to glory; over you are raised costly
tombs, but both you and your wealth are doomed to burning. I
beseech you, reader, whoever you may be, to remember Jerome the
sinner. He, if God would give him his choice, would sooner take
Paul's tunics with his merits, than the purple of kings with their
punishment."</p>
<p>Such was the story circulated among rich and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> poor, appealing with
wondrous force to the hearts of men in those wretched years.</p>
<p>What was the effect upon the mind of the thoughtful? If he
believed such teaching, weary of the wickedness of the age, and
moved by his noblest sentiments, he sold his tunics wrought of gold
and fled from his palaces of marble to the desert solitudes.</p>
<p>But the monastic story that most strongly impressed the age now
under consideration, was the biography of Anthony, "the patriarch
of monks" and virtual founder of Christian monasticism. It was said
to have been written by Athanasius, the famous defender of
orthodoxy and Archbishop of Alexandria; yet some authorities reject
his authorship. It exerted a power over the minds of men beyond all
human estimate. It scattered the seeds of asceticism wherever it
was read. Traces of its influence are found all over the Roman
empire, in Egypt, Asia Minor, Palestine, Italy and Gaul. Knowing
the character of Athanasius, we may rest assured that he sincerely
believed all he really recorded (it is much interpolated) of the
strange life of Anthony, and, true or false, thousands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> others
believed in him and in his story. Augustine, the great theologian
of immortal fame, acknowledged that this book was one of the
influences that led to his conversion, and Jerome, whose life I
will review later, was mightily swayed by it.</p>
<p>Anthony was born about 251 A.D., in Upper Egypt, of wealthy and
noble parentage. He was a pious child, an obedient son, and a lover
of solitude and books. His parents died when he was about twenty
years old, leaving to his care their home and his little sister.
One day, as he entered the church, meditating on the poverty of
Christ, a theme much reflected upon in those days, he heard these
words read from the pulpit, "If thou wouldst be perfect, go and
sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow
me." As if the call came straight from heaven to his own soul, he
left the church at once and made over his farm to the people of the
village. He sold his personal possessions for a large sum, and
distributed the proceeds among the poor, reserving a little for his
sister. Still he was unsatisfied. Entering the church on another
occasion, he heard our Lord saying in the gospel, "Take no thought
for the morrow." The clouds <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> cleared away. His anxious search for
truth and duty was at an end. He went out and gave away the remnant
of his belongings. Placing his sister in a convent, the existence
of which is to be noted, he fled to the desert. Then follows a
striking statement, "For monasteries were not common in Egypt, nor
had any monk at all known the great desert; but every one who
wished to devote himself to his own spiritual welfare performed his
exercise alone, not far from the village."</p>
<p>Laboring with his hands, recalling texts of Scripture, praying
whole sleepless nights, fasting for several days at a time,
visiting his fellow saints, fighting demons, so passed the long
years away. He slept on a small rush mat, more often on the bare
ground. Forgetting past austerities, he was ever on the search for
some new torture and pressing forward to new and strange
experiences. He changed his habitation from time to time. Now he
lived in a tomb, in company with the silent dead; then for twenty
years in a deserted castle, full of reptiles, never going out and
rarely seeing any one. From each saint he learned some fresh mode
of spiritual training, observing his practice for future imitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> and
studying the charms of his Christian character that he might
reproduce them in his own life; thus he would return richly laden
to his cell.</p>
<p>But in all these struggles Anthony had one foe--the arch-enemy
of all good. He suggests impure thoughts, but the saint repels them
by prayer; he incites to passion, but the hero resists the fiend
with fastings and faith. Once the dragon, foiled in his attempt to
overcome Anthony, gnashed his teeth, and coming out of his body,
lay at his feet in the shape of a little black boy. But the hermit
was not beguiled into carelessness by this victory. He resolved to
chastise himself more severely. So he retired to the tombs of the
dead. One dark night a crowd of demons flogged the saint until he
fell to the ground speechless with torture. Some friends found him
the next day, and thinking that he was dead, carried him to the
village, where his kinsfolk gathered to mourn over his remains. But
at midnight he came to himself, and, seeing but one acquaintance
awake, he begged that he would carry him back to the tombs, which
was done. Unable to move, he prayed prostrate and sang, "If an host
be laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid." <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> The enraged devils
made at him again. There was a terrible crash; through the walls
the fiends came in shapes like beasts and reptiles. In a moment the
place was filled with lions roaring at him, bulls thrusting at him
with their horns, creeping serpents unable to reach him, wolves
held back in the act of springing. There, too, were bears and asps
and scorpions. Mid the frightful clamor of roars, growls and
hisses, rose the clear voice of the saint, as he triumphantly
mocked the demons in their rage. Suddenly the awful tumult ceased;
the wretched beings became invisible and a ray of light pierced the
roof to cheer the prostrate hero. His pains ceased. A voice came to
him saying, "Thou hast withstood and not yielded. I will always be
thy helper, and will make thy name famous everywhere." Hearing this
he rose up and prayed, and was stronger in body than ever
before.</p>
<p>This is but one of numerous stories chronicling Anthony's
struggles with the devil. Like conflicts were going on at that hour
in many another cave in those great and silent mountains.</p>
<p>There are also wondrous tales of his miraculous power. He often
predicted the coming of sufferers <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> and healed them when they came. His
fame for curing diseases and casting out devils became so extensive
that Egypt marveled at his gifts, and saints came even from Rome to
see his face and to hear his words. His freedom from pride and
arrogance was as marked as his fame was great. He yielded joyful
obedience to presbyters and bishops. His countenance was so full of
divine grace and heavenly beauty as to render him easily
distinguishable in a crowd of monks. Letters poured in upon him
from every part of the empire. Kings wrote for his advice, but it
neither amazed him nor filled his heart with pride. "Wonder not,"
said he, "if a king writes to us, for he is but a man, but wonder
rather that God has written His law to man and spoken to us by His
Son." At his command princes laid aside their crowns, judges their
magisterial robes, while criminals forsook their lives of crime and
embraced with joy the life of the desert.</p>
<p>Once, at the earnest entreaty of some magistrates, he came down
from the mountain that they might see him. Urged to prolong his
stay he refused, saying, "Fishes, if they lie long on the dry land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> die; so
monks who stay with you lose their strength. As the fishes, then,
hasten to the sea, so must we to the mountains."</p>
<p>At last the shadows lengthened and waning strength proclaimed
that his departure was nigh. Bidding farewell to his monks, he
retired to an inner mountain and laid himself down to die. His
countenance brightened as if he saw his friends coming to see him,
and thus his soul was gathered to his fathers. He is said to have
been mourned by fifteen thousand disciples.</p>
<p>This is the story which moved a dying empire. "Anthony," says
Athanasius, "became known not by worldly wisdom, nor by any art, but
solely by piety, and that this was the gift of God who can deny?"
The purpose of such a life was, so his biographer thought, to light
up the moral path for men, that they might imbibe a zeal for
virtue.</p>
<p>The "Life of St. Anthony" is even more remarkable for its
omissions than for its incredible tales. While I reserve a more
detailed criticism of its Christian ideals until a subsequent
chapter, it may be well to quote here a few words from Isaac
Taylor. After pointing out some of its defects he <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> continues: there is
"not a word of justification by faith; not a word of the gracious
influence of the Spirit in renewing and cleansing the heart; not a
word responding to any of those signal passages of Scripture which
make the Gospel 'Glad Tidings' to guilty men." This I must confess
to be true, even though I may and do heartily esteem the saint's
enthusiasm for righteousness.</p>
<p>So far I have described chiefly the spiritual experiences of
these men, but the details of their physical life are hardly less
interesting. There was a holy rivalry among them to excel in
self-torture. Their imaginations were constantly employed in
devising unique tests of holiness and courage. They lived in holes
in the ground or in dried up wells; they slept in thorn bushes or
passed days and weeks without sleep; they courted the company of
the wildest beasts and exposed their naked bodies to the broiling
sun. Macarius became angry because an insect bit him and in
penitence flung himself into a marsh where he lived for weeks. He
was so badly stung by gnats and flies that his friends hardly knew
him. Hilarion, at twenty years of age, was more like a spectre than
a living man. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>[pg
50]</span> His cell was only five feet high, a little lower than
his stature. Some carried weights equal to eighty or one hundred
and fifty pounds suspended from their bodies. Others slept standing
against the rocks. For three years, as it is recorded, one of them
never reclined. In their zeal to obey the Scriptures, they
overlooked the fact that cleanliness is akin to godliness. It was
their boast that they never washed. One saint would not even use
water to drink, but quenched his thirst with the dew that fell on
the grass. St. Abraham never washed his face for fifty years. His
biographer, not in the least disturbed by the disagreeable
suggestions of this circumstance, proudly says, "His face reflected
the purity of his soul." If so, one is moved to think that the
inward light must indeed have been powerfully piercing, if it could
brighten a countenance unwashed for half a century. There is a
story about Abbot Theodosius who prayed for water that his monks
might drink. In response to his petition a stream burst from the
rocks, but the foolish monks, overcome by a pitiful weakness for
cleanliness, persuaded the abbot to erect a bath, when lo, the
stream dried. Supplications and repentance availed nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> After a
year had passed, the monks, promising never again to insult Heaven
by wishing for a bath, were granted a second Mosaic miracle.</p>
<p>Thus, unwashed, clothed in rags, their hair uncut, their faces
unshaven, they lived for years. No wonder that to their disordered
fancy the desert was filled with devils, the animals spake and
Heaven sent angels to minister unto them.</p>

<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Pillar_Saint"></a>The Pillar Saint</i></h2>
<br>
<p>But the strangest of all strange narratives yet remains. We turn
from Egypt to Asia Minor to make the acquaintance of that saint
whom Tennyson has immortalized,--the idol of monarchs and the pride
of the East,--Saint Simeon Stylites. Stories grow rank around him
like the luxuriant products of a tropical soil. How shall I briefly
tell of this man, whom Theodoret, in his zeal, declares all who
obey the Roman rule know--the man who may be compared with Moses
the Legislator, David the King and Micah the Prophet? He lived
between the years 390 and 459 A.D. He was a shepherd's son, but at
an early age entered a monastery. Here <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> he soon distinguished
himself by his excessive austerities. One day he went to the well,
removed the rope from the bucket and bound it tightly around his
body underneath his clothes. A few weeks later, the abbot, being
angry with him because of his extreme self-torture, bade his
companions strip him. What was his astonishment to find the rope
from the well sunk deeply into his flesh. "Whence," he cried, "has
this man come to us, wanting to destroy the rule of this monastery?
I pray thee depart hence."</p>
<p>With great trouble they unwound the rope and the flesh with it,
and taking care of him until he was well, they sent him forth to
commence a life of austerities that was to render him famous. He
adopted various styles of existence, but his miracles and piety
attracted such crowds that he determined to invent a mode of life
which would deliver him from the pressing multitudes. It is curious
that he did not hide himself altogether if he really wished to
escape notoriety; but, no, he would still be within the gaze of
admiring throngs. His holy and fanciful genius hit upon a scheme
that gave him his peculiar name. He took up his abode on the top
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> of a
column which was at first about twelve feet high, but was gradually
elevated until it measured sixty-four feet. Hence, he is called
Simeon Stylites, or Simeon the Pillar Saint.</p>
<p>On this lofty column, betwixt earth and heaven, the hermit
braved the heat and cold of thirty years. At its base, from morning
to night, prayed the admiring worshipers. Kings kneeled in crowds
of peasants to do him homage and ask his blessing. Theodoret says,
"The Ishmaelites, coming by tribes of two hundred and three hundred
at a time, and sometimes even a thousand, deny, with shouts, the
error of their fathers, and breaking in pieces before that great
illuminator, the images which they had worshiped, and renouncing
the orgies of Venus, they received the Divine sacrament." Rude
barbarians confessed their sins in tears. Persians, Greeks, Romans
and Saracens, forgetting their mutual hatred, united in praise and
prayer at the feet of this strange character.</p>
<p>Once a week the hero partook of food. Many times a day he bowed
his head to his feet; one man counted twelve hundred and forty-four
times and then stopped in sheer weariness from gazing at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> miracle
of endurance aloft. Again, from the setting of the sun to its
appearance in the East, he would stand unsoothed by sleep with his
arms outstretched like a cross.</p>
<p>If genius can understand such a life as that and fancy the
thoughts of such a soul, Tennyson seems not only to have
comprehended the consciousness of the Pillar Saint, but also to
have succeeded in giving expression to his insight. He has laid
bare the soul of Simeon in its commingling of spiritual pride with
affected humility, and of a consciousness of meritorious sacrifice
with a sense of sin. The Saint spurns notoriety and the homage of
men, yet exults in his control over the multitudes.</p>
<p>The poet thus imagines Simeon to speak as the Saint is praying
God to take away his sin:</p>
<blockquote>"But yet<br>
Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints<br>
Enjoy themselves in heaven, and men on earth<br>
House in the shade of comfortable roofs,<br>
Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food,<br>
And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls,<br>
I, 'tween the spring and downfall of the light,<br>
Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,<br>
To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints;<br>
Or in the night, after a little sleep,<br>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> I wake:
the chill stars sparkle; I am wet<br>
With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost.<br>
I wear an undress'd goatskin on my back;<br>
A grazing iron collar grinds my neck;<br>
And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross,<br>
And strive and wrestle with thee till I die:<br>
O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin.<br>
<br>
O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am;<br>
A sinful man, conceived and born in sin:<br>
'Tis their own doing; this is none of mine;<br>
Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this,<br>
That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha!<br>
They think that I am somewhat. What am I?<br>
The silly people take me for a saint,<br>
And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers:<br>
And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here)<br>
Have all in all endured as much, and more<br>
Than many just and holy men, whose names<br>
Are register'd and calendared for saints.<br>
<br>
Good people, you do ill to kneel to me.<br>
What is it I can have done to merit this?<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
Yet do not rise; for you may look on me,<br>
And in your looking you may kneel to God.<br>
Speak! is there any of you halt or maim'd?<br>
I think you know I have some power with Heaven<br>
From my long penance: let him speak his wish.<br>
<br>
Yes, I can heal him. Power goes forth from me.<br>
They say that they are heal'd. Ah, hark! they shout<br>
'St. Simeon Stylites.' Why, if so,<br>
God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul,<br>
God reaps a harvest in thee.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this be,<br>
Can I work miracles and not be saved?"</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
<p>Once, the devil, in shape like an angel, riding in a chariot of
fire, came to carry Simeon to the skies. He whispered to the weary
Saint, "Simeon, hear my words, which the Lord hath commanded thee.
He has sent me, his angel, that I may carry thee away as I carried
Elijah." Simeon was deceived, and lifted his foot to step out into
the chariot, when the angel vanished, and in punishment for his
presumption an ulcer appeared upon his thigh.</p>
<p>But time plays havoc with saints as well as sinners, and death
slays the strongest. Bowed in prayer, his weary heart ceased to
beat and the eyes that gazed aloft were closed forever. Anthony,
his beloved disciple, ascending the column, found that his master
was no more. Yet, it seemed as if Simeon was loath to leave the
spot, for his spirit appeared to his weeping follower and said, "I
will not leave this column, and this blessed mountain. For I have
gone to rest, as the Lord willed, but do thou not cease to minister
in this place and the Lord will repay thee in heaven."</p>
<p>His body was carried down the mountain to Antioch. Heading the
solemn procession were the patriarch, six bishops, twenty-one
counts and six <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[pg
57]</span> thousand soldiers, "and Antioch," says Gibbon, "revered
his bones as her glorious ornament and impregnable defence."</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Cenobites_of_the_East"></a>The Cenobites of the
East</i></h2>
<br>
<p>We cannot linger with these hermits. I pass now to the
cenobitic[<a href="#NOTE_C">C</a>] life. We go back in years and
return to Egypt. Man is a social animal, and the social instinct is
so strong that even hermits are swayed by its power and get tired
of living apart from one another. When Anthony died the deserts
were studded with hermitages, and those of exceptional fame were
surrounded by little clusters of huts and dens. Into these cells
crowded the hermits who wished to be near their master.</p>
<p>Thus, step by step, organized or cenobitic monasticism easily
and naturally came into existence. The anchorites crawled from
their dens every day to hear the words of their chief saint,--a
practice giving rise to stated meetings, with rules for worship.
Regulations as to meals, occupations, dress, penances, and prayers
naturally follow.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
<p>The author of the first monastic rules is said to have been
Pachomius, who was born in Egypt about the year 292 A.D. He was
brought up in paganism but was converted in early life while in the
army. On his discharge he retired with a hermit to Tabenna, an
island in the Nile. It is said he never ate a full meal after his
conversion, and for fifteen years slept sitting on a stone. Natural
gifts fitted him to become a leader, and it was not long before he
was surrounded by a congregation of monks for whom he made his
rules.</p>
<p>The monks of Pachomius were divided into bands of tens and
hundreds, each tenth man being an under officer in turn subject to
the hundredth, and all subject to the superior or abbot of the
mother house. They lived three in a cell, and a congregation of
cells constituted a laura or monastery. There was a common room for
meals and worship. Each monk wore a close fitting tunic and a white
goatskin upper garment which was never laid aside at meals or in
bed, but only at the Eucharist. Their food usually consisted of
bread and water, but occasionally they enjoyed such luxuries as
oil, salt, fruits and vegetables. They ate in silence, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> was
sometimes broken by the solemn voice of a reader.</p>
<p>"No man," says Jerome, "dares look at his neighbor or clear his
throat. Silent tears roll down their cheeks, but not a sob escapes
their lips." Their labors consisted of some light handiwork or
tilling the fields. They grafted trees, made beehives, twisted
fish-lines, wove baskets and copied manuscripts. It was early
apparent that as man could not live alone so he could not live
without labor. We shall see this principle emphasized more clearly
by Benedict, but it is well to notice that at this remote day
provision was made for secular employments. Jerome enjoins
Rusticus, a young monk, always to have some work on hand that the
devil may find him busy. "Hoe your ground," says he, "set out
cabbages; convey water to them in conduits, that you may see with
your own eyes the lovely vision of the poet,--</p>
<blockquote>"Art draws fresh water from the hilltop near,<br>
Till the stream, flashing down among the rocks,<br>
Cools the parched meadows and allays their thirst."</blockquote>
<p>There were individual cases of excessive self-torture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> even
among these congregations of monks but we may say that ordinarily,
organized monasticism was altogether less severe upon the
individual than anchoretic life. The fact that the monk was seeking
human fellowship is evidence that he was becoming more humane, and
this softening of his spirit betrayed itself in his treatment of
himself. The aspect of life became a little brighter and
happier.</p>
<p>Four objects were comprehended in these monastic
roles,--solitude, manual labor, fasting and prayer. We need not
pity these dwellers far from walled cities and the marts of trade.
Indeed, they claim no sympathy. Religious ideals can make strange
transformations in man's disposition and tastes. They loved their
hard lives.</p>
<p>The hermit Abraham said to John Cassian, "We know that in these,
our regions, there are some secret and pleasant places, where
fruits are abundant and the beauty and fertility of the gardens
would supply our necessities with the slightest toil. We prefer the
wilderness of this desolation before all that is fair and
attractive, admitting no comparison between the luxuriance of the
most exuberant <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>[pg
61]</span> soil and the bitterness of these sands." Jerome himself
exclaimed, "Others may think what they like and follow each his own
bent. But to me a town is a prison and solitude paradise."</p>
<p>The three vows of chastity, poverty and obedience were adopted
and became the foundation stones of the monastic institution, to be
found in every monastic order. There is a typical illustration in
Kingsley's Hypatia of what they meant by obedience. Philammon, a
young monk, was consigned to the care of Cyril, the Bishop of
Alexandria, and a factious, cruel man, with an imperious will. The
bishop received and read his letter of introduction and thus
addressed its bearer, "Philammon, a Greek. You are said to have
learned to obey. If so, you have also learned to rule. Your
father-abbot has transferred you to my tutelage. You are now to
obey me." "And I will," was the quick response. "Well said. Go to
that window and leap forth into the court." Philammon walked to it
and opened it. The pavement was fully twenty feet below, but his
business was to obey and not to take measurements. There was a
flower in a vase upon the sill. He quietly removed it, and in an
instant would have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>[pg
62]</span> leaped for life or death, when Cyril's voice thundered,
"Stop!"</p>
<p>The Pachomian monks despised possessions of every kind. The
following pathetic incident shows the frightful extent to which
they carried this principle, and also illustrates the character of
that submission to which the novitiate voluntarily assented:
Cassian described how Mutius sold his possessions and with his
little child of eight asked admission to a monastery. The monks
received but disciplined him. "He had already forgotten that he was
rich, he must forget that he was a father." His child was taken,
clothed in rags, beaten and spurned. Obedience compelled the father
to look upon his child wasting with pain and grief, but such was
his love for Christ, says the narrator, that his heart was rigid
and immovable. He was then told to throw the boy into the river,
but was stopped in the act of obeying.</p>
<p>Yet men, women, and even children, coveted this life of
unnatural deprivations. "Posterity," says Gibbon, "might repeat the
saying which had formerly been applied to the sacred animals of the
same country, that in Egypt it was less difficult to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> find a god than a
man." Though the hermit did not claim to be a god, yet there were
more monks in many monasteries than inhabitants in the neighboring
villages. Pachomius had fourteen hundred monks in his own monastery
and seven thousand under his rule. Jerome says fifty thousand monks
were sometimes assembled at Easter in the deserts of Nitria. It was
not uncommon for an abbot to command five thousand monks. St.
Serapion boasted of ten thousand. Altogether, so we are told, there
were in the fifth century more than one hundred thousand persons in
the monasteries, three-fourths of whom were men.</p>
<p>The rule of Pachomius spread over Egypt into Syria and
Palestine. It was carried by Athanasius into Italy and Gaul. It
existed in various modified forms until it was supplanted by the
Benedictine rule.</p>
<p>Leaving Egypt, again we cross the Mediterranean into Asia Minor.
Near the Black Sea, in a wild forest abounding in savage rocks and
gloomy ravines, there dwelt a young man of twenty-six. He had
traveled in Egypt, Syria and Palestine. He had visited the hermits
of the desert and studied <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> philosophy and eloquence in cultured
Athens. In virtue eminent, in learning profound, this poetic soul
sought to realize its ideal in a lonely and cherished retreat--in a
solitude of Pontus.</p>
<p>The young monk is the illustrious saint and genius,--Basil the
Great,--the Bishop of C&aelig;sarea, and the virtual founder of the
monastic institution in the Greek church. The forest and glens
around his hut belonged to him, and on the other bank of the river
Iris his mother and sister were leading similar lives, having
abandoned earthly honors in pursuit of heaven. Hard crusts of bread
appeased his hunger. No fires, except those which burned within his
soul, protected him from the wintry blast. His years were few but
well spent. After a while his powerful intellect asserted itself
and he was led into a clearer view of the true spiritual life. His
practical mind revolted against the gross ignorance and meaningless
asceticism of Egypt. He determined to form an order that would
conform to the inner meaning of the Bible and to a more sensible
conception of the religious life. For his time he was a wise
legislator, a cunning workman and a daring thinker. The
modification of his ascetic <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> ideal was attended by painful
struggles. Many an hour he spent with his bosom friend, Gregory of
Nazianza, discussing the subject. The middle course which they
finally adopted is thus neatly described by Gregory:</p>
<blockquote>"Long was the inward strife, till ended thus:<br>
I saw, when men lived in the fretful world,<br>
They vantaged other men, but missed the while<br>
The calmness, and the pureness of their hearts.<br>
They who retired held an uprighter post,<br>
And raised their eyes with quiet strength toward heaven;<br>
Yet served self only, unfraternally.<br>
And so, 'twixt these and those, I struck my path,<br>
To meditate with the free solitary,<br>
Yet to live secular, and serve mankind."</blockquote>
<p>Monks in large numbers flocked to this mountain retreat of
Basil's. These he banded together in an organization, the remains
of which still live in the Greek church. So great is the influence
of his life and teachings, "that it is common though erroneous to
call all Oriental monks Basilians." His rules are drawn up in the
form of answers to two hundred and three questions. He added to the
three monastic vows a fourth, which many authorities claim now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> appeared
for the first time,--namely, that of irrevocable vows--once a monk,
always a monk.</p>
<p>Basil did not condemn marriage, but he believed that it was
incompatible with the highest spiritual attainments. For the
Kingdom of God's sake it was necessary to forsake all. "Love not
the world, neither the things of the world," embraced to his mind
the married state. By avoiding the cares of marriage a man was sure
to escape, so he thought, the gross sensuality of the age. He
struck at the dangers which attend the possession of riches, by
enforcing poverty. An abbot was appointed over his cloisters to
whom absolute obedience was demanded. Everywhere men needed this
lesson of obedience. The discipline of the armies was relaxed. The
authority of religion was set at naught; laxity and disorder
prevailed even among the monks. They went roaming over the country
controlled only by their whims. Insubordination had to be checked
or the monastic institution was doomed. Hence, Basil was particular
to enforce a respect for law and order.</p>
<p>Altogether this was an honest and serious attempt <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> to introduce fresh
power into a corrupt age and to faithfully observe the Biblical
commands as Basil understood them. The floods of iniquity were
engulfing even the church. A new standard had to be raised and an
inner circle of pious and zealous believers gathered from the
multitude of half-pagan Christians, or all was lost.</p>
<p>The subsequent history of Greek monachism has little interest.
In Russia, at a late date, the Greek monks served some purpose in
keeping alive the national spirit under the Tartar yoke, but the
practical benefits to the East were few, in comparison with the
vigorous life of the Western monasticism.</p>
<p>Montalembert, the brilliant champion of Christian monasticism,
becomes an adverse critic of the system in the East, although it is
noteworthy he now speaks of monasticism as it appears in the Greek
church, which he holds to be heretical; yet his indictment is quite
true: "They yielded to all the deleterious impulses of that
declining society. They have saved nothing, regenerated nothing,
elevated nothing."</p>
<p>We have visited the hermit in the desert and in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> the monastery
governed by its abbot and its rules. We must view the monk in one
other aspect, that of theological champion. Here the hermit and the
monk of the monastery meet on common ground. They were fighters,
not debaters; fighters, not disciplined soldiers; fighters, not
persuading Christians. They swarmed down from the mountains like
hungry wolves. They fought heretics, they fought bishops, they
fought Roman authorities, they fought soldiers, and fought one
another. Ignorant, fanatical and cruel, they incited riots,
disturbed the public peace and shed the blood of foes.</p>
<p>Theological discord was made a thousand times more bitter by
their participation in the controversies of the time. Furious monks
became the armed champions of Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria. They
insulted the prefect, drove out the Jews and, to the everlasting
disgrace of the monks, Cyril and the church, they dragged the
lovely Hypatia from her lecture hall and slew her with all the
cruelty satanic ingenuity could devise. Against a background of
black and angry sky she stands forth, as a soul through whose
reason God made himself manifest. Her unblemished character, her
learning <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>
and her grace forever cry aloud against an orthodoxy bereft alike
of reason and of the spirit of the Nazarene.</p>
<p>The fighting monks crowded councils and forced decisions. They
deposed hostile bishops or kept their favorites in power by murder
and violence. Two black-cowled armies met in Constantinople, and
amid curses fought with sticks and stones a battle of creeds. Cries
of "Holy! Holy! Holy!" mingled with, "It's the day of martyrdom!
Down with the tyrant!" The whole East was kept in a feverish state.
The Imperial soldiers confessed their justifiable fears when they
said, "We would rather fight with barbarians than with these
monks."</p>
<p>No wonder our perplexity increases and it seems impossible to
determine what these men really did for the cause of truth. We have
been unable to distinguish the hermit from the beasts of the
fields. We hear his groans, see his tears, and watch him struggle
with demons. We are disgusted with his filth, amused at his
fancies, grieved at his superstition. We pity his agony and admire
his courage. We watch the progress of order and rule out of chaos.
We see monasteries grow up around damp <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> caves and dismal
huts. We behold Simeon praying among the birds of heaven, and look
into the face of the young and handsome Basil, in whom the monastic
institution of the East reaches the zenith of its power.</p>
<p>I am free to confess a profound reverence for many of these men
determined at all hazards to keep their souls unspotted from the
world. I bow before a passion for righteousness ready to part with
life itself if necessary. Yet the gross extravagances, the almost
incredible absurdities of their unnatural lives compel us to
withhold our judgment.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, the strange life of those far-off years is
an eloquent testimony to the indestructible craving of the human
soul for self-mastery and soul-purity.</p>

<h3><i><a name="MONASTICISM_IN_THE_WEST"></a>MONASTICISM IN THE
WEST: ANTE-BENEDICTINE MONKS 340-480 A.D.</i></h3>
<br>
<p>We are now to follow the fortunes of the monastic system from
its introduction in Rome to the time of Benedict of Nursia, the
founder of the first great monastic order.</p>
<p>Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, who made
Christianity the predominant religion in the Roman Empire, died in
337 A.D. Three years later Rome heard, probably for the first time,
an authentic account of the Egyptian hermits. The story was carried
to the Eternal City by Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, one of the
most remarkable characters in the early church, a man of surpassing
courage and perseverance, an intrepid foe of heresy, "heroic and
invincible," as Milton styled him. Twenty of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> forty-six years of
his official life were spent in banishment.</p>
<p>Athanasius was an intimate friend of the hermit Anthony and a
persistent advocate of the ascetic ideal. When he fled to Rome, in
340, to escape the persecutions of the Arians, he took with him two
specimens of monastic virtue--Ammonius and Isidore. These hermits,
so filthy and savage in appearance, albeit, as I trust, clean in
heart, excited general disgust, and their story of the tortures and
holiness of their Egyptian brethren was received with derision. But
men who had faced and conquered the terrors of the desert were not
to be so easily repulsed. Aided by other ascetic travelers from the
East they persisted in their propaganda until contempt yielded to
admiration. The enthusiasm of the uncouth hermits became
contagious. The Christians in Rome now welcomed the story of the
recluses as a Divine call to abandon a dissolute society for the
peace and joy of a desert life.</p>
<p>But before this transformation of public opinion can be
appreciated, it is needful to know something of the social and
religious condition of Rome in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> the days when Athanasius and his
hermits walked her streets.</p>
<p>After suffering frightful persecutions for three centuries, the
Church had at last nominally conquered the Roman Empire; nominally,
because although Christianity was to live, the Empire had to die.
"No medicine could have prevented the diseased old body from dying.
The time had come. When the wretched inebriate embraces a spiritual
religion with one foot in the grave, with a constitution completely
undermined, and the seeds of death planted, then no repentance or
lofty aspiration can prevent physical death. It was so in Rome."
The death-throes were long and lingering, as befits the end of a
mighty giant, but death was certain. There are many facts which
explain the inability of a conquering faith to save a tottering
empire, but it is impracticable for us to enter upon that wide
field. Some help may be gained from that which follows.</p>
<p>Of morals, Rome was destitute. She possessed the material
remains and superficial acquirements of a proud civilization, such
as great public highways, marble palaces, public baths, temples and
libraries. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>[pg
74]</span> Elegance of manners and acquisitions of wealth indicate
specious outward refinement. But these things are not sufficient to
guarantee the permanence of institutions or the moral welfare of a
nation. In the souls of men there was a fatal degeneracy. There was
outward prosperity but inward corruption.</p>
<p>Professor Samuel Dill, in his highly instructive work on "Roman
Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire," points out the
fact that Rome's fall was due to economic and political causes as
well as to the deterioration of her morals. A close study of these
causes, however, will reveal the presence of moral influences.
Professor Dill says: "The general tendency of modern inquiry has to
discover in the fall of that august and magnificent organization,
not a cataclysm, precipitated by the impact of barbarous forces,
but a process slowly prepared and evolved by internal and economic
causes." Two of these causes were the dying out of municipal
liberty and self-government, and the separation of the upper class
from the masses by sharp distributions of wealth and privilege. It
is indeed true that these causes contributed to Rome's ruin;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> that the
central government was weak; that the civil service was oppressive
and corrupt; that the aristocratic class was selfish; and that the
small landed proprietors were steadily growing poorer and fewer,
while, on the contrary, the upper or senatorial class was
increasing in wealth and power. But after due emphasis has been
accorded to these destructive factors, it yet remains true that the
want of public spirit and the prevailing cultivated selfishness may
be traced to a decline of faith in those religious ideals that
serve to stimulate the moral life and thus preserve the national
integrity.</p>
<p>Society was divided into three classes. It is computed that
one-half the population were slaves. A large majority of the
remainder were paupers, living on public charity, and constituting
a festering sore that threatened the life of the social organism.
The rich, who were relatively few, squandered princely incomes in a
single night, and exhausted their imaginations devising new and
expensive forms of sensuous pleasure. The profligacy of the nobles
almost surpasses credibility, so that trustworthy descriptions read
like works of fiction. Farrar says: "A whole population might be
trembling lest they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>[pg
76]</span> should be starved by the delay of an Alexandrian corn
ship, while the upper classes were squandering a fortune at a
single banquet, drinking out of myrrhine and jeweled vases worth
hundreds of pounds, and feasting on the brains of peacocks and the
tongues of nightingales." The frivolity of the social and political
leaders of Rome, the insane thirst for lust and luxury, the absence
of seriousness in the face of frightful, impending ruin, almost
justify the epigram of Silvianus, "Rome was laughing when she
died."</p>
<blockquote>"On that hard pagan world disgust<br>
And secret loathing fell;<br>
Deep weariness and sated lust<br>
Made human life a hell.<br>
In his cool hall, with haggard eyes,<br>
The Roman noble lay;<br>
He drove abroad in furious guise<br>
Along the Appian Way;<br>
He made a feast, drank fierce and fast,<br>
And crowned his hair with flowers<br>
No easier nor no guicker past<br>
The impracticable hours."</blockquote>
<p>Pagan mythology and Pagan philosophy were powerless to resist
this downward tendency. Although Christianity had become the state
religion, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
it was itself in great danger of yielding to the decay that
prevailed. The Empire was, in fact, but nominally Christian.
Thousands of ecclesiastical adherents were half pagan in their
spirit and practice. Harnack declares, "They were too deeply
affected by Christianity to abandon it, but too little to be
Christians. Pure religious enthusiasm waned, ideals received a new
form, and the dependence and responsibility of individuals became
weaker." Even ordinary courage had everywhere declined and the
pleasures of the senses controlled the heart of Christian
society.</p>
<p>Many of the men who should have resisted this gross
secularization of the church, who ought to have set their faces
against the departure from apostolic ideals by exalting the
standards of the earlier Christianity; these men, the clergy of the
Christian church, had deserted their post of duty and surrendered
to the prevailing worldliness.</p>
<p>Jerome describes, with justifiable sarcasm, these moral
weaklings, charged with the solemn responsibility of preaching a
pure gospel to a dying empire. "Such men think of nothing but their
dress; they use perfumes freely, and see that there <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> are no creases in
their leather shoes. Their curling hair shows traces of the tongs;
their fingers glisten with rings; they walk on tiptoe across a damp
road, not to splash their feet. When you see men acting that way,
think of them rather as bridegrooms than as clergymen. If he sees a
pillow that takes his fancy, or an elegant table-cover, or, indeed,
any article of furniture, he praises it, looks admiringly at it,
takes it into his hand, and, complaining that he has nothing of the
kind, begs or rather extorts it from its owner." Such trifling
folly was fatal. The times demanded men of vigorous spirit, who
dared to face the general decline, and cry out in strong tones
against it. The age needed moral warriors, with the old Roman
courage and love of sacrifice; martyrs willing to rot in prison or
shed their blood in the street, not effeminate men, toying with
fancy table-covers and tiptoeing across a sprinkled road. "And as a
background," says Kingsley, "to all this seething heap of
corruption, misrule and misery, hung the black cloud of the
barbarians, the Teutonic tribes from whom we derive our best blood,
ever coming nearer and nearer, waxing stronger and stronger, to be
soon the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
conquerors of the C&aelig;sars and the masters of the world." But
there were many pure and sincere Christians--a saving remnant. The
joyous alacrity with which men and women responded to the monastic
call, and entered upon careers of self-torture for the sake of
deliverance from moral corruption, shows that the spirit of true
faith was not extinct. These seekers after righteousness may be
described as "a dismal and fanatical set of men, overlooking the
practical aims of life," but it is a fair question to ask, "if they
had not abandoned the world to its fate would they not have shared
that fate?" "The glory of that age," says Professor Dill, "is the
number of those who were capable of such self-surrender; and an age
should be judged by its ideals, not by the mediocrity of
conventional religion masking worldly self-indulgence. This we have
always with us; the other we have not always."</p>
<p>Yet the sad fact remains that the transforming power of
Christianity was practically helpless before the surging floods of
vice and superstition. The noble struggles of a few saints were as
straws in a hurricane. The church had all she could do to save
herself.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
<p>"When Christianity itself was in such need of reform," says
Lord, "when Christians could scarcely be distinguished from pagans
in love of display, and in egotistical ends, how could it reform
the world? When it was a pageant, a ritualism, an arm of the state,
a vain philosophy, a superstition, a formula, how could it save, if
ever so dominant? The corruptions of the church in the fourth
century are as well authenticated as the purity and moral elevation
of Christians in the second century." Even in the early days of
Christianity the ruin of Rome was impending, but, at that time, the
adherents of the Christian religion were few and poor. They did not
possess enough power and influence to save the state. When
monasticism came to Rome, the lords of the church were getting
ready to sit upon the thrones of princes, but the dazzling victory
of the church was not a spiritual conquest of sin, so the last ray
of hope for the Empire was extinguished. Her fall was
inevitable.</p>
<p>With this outlined picture in mind, fancy Athanasius and his
monks at Rome. These men despise luxury and contemn riches. They
have come to make Rome ring with the old war cries,--although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> they
wrestled not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual
wickedness in high places. Terror and despair are on every side,
but they are not afraid. They know what it means to face the demons
of the desert, to lie down at night with wild beasts for
companions. They have not yielded to the depravity of the human
heart and the temptations of a licentious age. They have conquered
sinful appetites by self-abnegation and fasting. They come to a
distracted society with a message of peace--a peace won by
courageous self-sacrifice. They call men to save their perishing
souls by surrendering their wills to God and enlisting in a
campaign against the powers of darkness. They appeal to the ancient
spirit of courage and love of hardship. They arouse the dormant
moral energies of the profligate nobles, proud of the past and sick
of the present. The story of Anthony admonished Rome that a life of
sensuous gratification was inglorious, unworthy of the true Roman,
and that the flesh could be mastered by heroic endeavor.</p>
<p>Women, who spent their hours in frivolous amusements, welcomed
with gratitude the discovery that they could be happy without
degradation, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[pg
82]</span> joyfully responded to the call of righteousness.
"Despising themselves," says Kingsley, "despising their husbands to
whom they had been wedded in loveless wedlock, they too fled from a
world which had sated and sickened them."</p>
<p>Woman's natural craving for lofty friendships and pure
aspirations found satisfaction in the monastic ideal. She fled from
the incessant broils of a corrupt court, from the courtesans that
usurped the place of the wife, from the insolence and selfishness
of men who scorned even the appearance of virtue and did not
hesitate to degrade even their wives and sisters. She would
disprove the biting sarcasm of Juvenal,--</p>
<blockquote>"Women, in judgment weak, in feeling strong,<br>
By every gust of passion borne along.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
A woman stops at nothing, when she wears<br>
Rich emeralds round her neck, and in her ears<br>
Pearls of enormous size; these justify<br>
Her faults, and make all lawful in her eye."</blockquote>
<p>Therefore did the women hear with tremulous eagerness the story
of the saintly inhabitants of the desert, and flinging away their
trinkets, they hastened to the solitude of the cell, there to mourn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> their
folly and seek pardon and peace at the feet of the Most High.</p>
<p>Likewise, the men, born to nobler tasks than fawning upon
princes and squandering life and fortune in gluttony and
debauchery, blushed for shame, and abandoned forever the company of
sensualists and parasites. Potitianus, a young officer of rank,
read the life of Anthony, and cried to his fellow-soldier: "Tell
me, I pray thee, whither all our labors tend? What do we seek? For
whom do we carry arms? What can be our greatest hope in the palace
but to be friend to the Emperor? And how frail is that fortune!
What perils! When shall this be?" Inspired by the monastic story he
exchanged the friendship of the Emperor for the friendship of God,
and the military life lost all its attractiveness.</p>
<p>A philosopher and teacher hears the same narrative, and his
countenance becomes grave; he seizes the arm of Alypius, his
friend, and earnestly asks: "What, then, are we doing? How is this?
What hast thou been hearing? These ignorant men rise; they take
Heaven by force, and we, with our heartless sciences, behold us
wallowing in the flesh and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> in our blood! Is it shameful to follow
them, and are we not rather disgraced by not following them?" So,
disgusted with his self-seeking career, his round of empty
pleasures, he, too, is moved by this higher call to abandon his
wickedness and devote his genius to the cause of righteousness.</p>
<p>Ambrose, Paulinus, Chrysostom, Basil, Gregory, and many others,
holding important official posts or candidates for the highest
honors, abandoned all their chances of political preferment in
order to preach the gospel of ascetic Christianity.</p>
<p>Yes, for good or evil, Rome is profoundly stirred. The pale
monk, in all his filth and poverty, is the master of the best
hearts in the capital. Every one in whom aspiration is still alive,
who longs for some new light, and all who vaguely grope after a
higher life, hear his voice and become pliant to his will.</p>
<p>"Great historic movements," says Grimke, "are born not in
whirlwinds, in earthquakes, and pomps of human splendor and power,
but in the agonies and enthusiasms of grand, heroic spirits."
Monastic history, like secular, centers in the biographies of such
great men as Anthony, Basil, Jerome, Benedict, Francis, Dominic and
Loyola. To understand the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> character of the powerful forces set in
motion by the coming of the monks to Rome, it is necessary to know
the leading spirits whose preeminent abilities and lofty
personalities made Western monasticism what it was.</p>
<p>The time is about 418 A.D.; the place, a monastery in Bethlehem,
near the cave of the Nativity. In a lonely cell, within these
monastic walls, we shall find the man we seek. He is so old and
feeble that he has to be raised in his bed by means of a cord
affixed to the ceiling. He spends his time chiefly in reciting
prayers. His voice, once clear and resonant, sinks now to a
whisper. His failing vision no longer follows the classic pages of
Virgil or dwells fondly on the Hebrew of the Old Testament. This is
Saint Jerome, the champion of asceticism, the biographer of
hermits, the lion of Christian polemics, the translator of the
Bible, and the worthy, brilliant, determined foe of a dissolute
society and a worldly church. Although he spent thirty-four years
of his life in Palestine, I shall consider Jerome in connection
with the monasticism of the West, for it was in Rome that he
exercised his greatest influence. His translation of the Scriptures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> is the
Vulgate of the Roman church, and his name is enrolled in the
calendar of her saints. "He is," observes Schaff "the connecting
link between the Eastern and Western learning and religion."</p>
<p>By charming speech and eloquent tongue Jerome won over the men,
but principally the women, of Rome to the monastic life. So
powerful was his message when addressed to the feminine heart, that
mothers are said to have locked their daughters in their rooms lest
they should fall under the influence of his magnetic voice. It was
largely owing to his own labors that he could write in after years:
"Formerly, according to the testimony of the apostles, there were
few rich, few noble, few powerful among the Christians. Now, it is
no longer so. Not only among the Christians, but among the monks
are to be found a multitude of the wise, the noble and the
rich."</p>
<p>Near to the very year that Athanasius came to Rome, or about 340
A.D., Jerome was born at Stridon, in Dalmatia, in what is now
called the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. His parents were modestly
wealthy and were slaveholders. His student days were spent in Rome,
where he divided <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>[pg
87]</span> his time between the study of books and the revels of
the streets. One day some young Christians induced him to visit the
catacombs with them. Here, before the graves of Christian martyrs,
a quiet and holy influence stole into his heart, that finally led
to his conversion and baptism. Embracing the monastic ideal, he
gathered around him a few congenial friends, who joined him in a
covenant of rigid abstinence and ascetic discipline. Then followed
a year of travel with these companions, through Asia Minor, ending
disastrously at Antioch. One of his friends returned home, two of
them died, and he himself became so sick with fever that his life
was despaired of. Undismayed by these evils, brought on by
excessive austerities, he determined to retire to a life of
solitude.</p>
<p>About fifty miles southeast from Antioch was a barren waste of
nature but a paradise for monks--the Desert of Chalcis. On its
western border were several monasteries. All about for miles, the
dreary solitudes were peopled with shaggy hermits. They saw visions
and dreamed dreams in caves infested by serpents and wild beasts.
They lay upon the sands, scorched in summer by the blazing sun, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> chilled
in winter by the winds that blew from snowcapped mountains. For
five years, Jerome dwelt among these demon-fighting recluses. Clad
in sackcloth stained by penitential tears, he toiled for his daily
bread, and struggled against visions of Roman dancing girls. He was
a most industrious reader of books and a great lover of debate.
Monks from far and near visited him, and together they discussed
questions of theology and philosophy.</p>
<p>But we may not follow this varied and eventful life in all its
details. After a year or two spent at Constantinople, and three
years at Rome, he returned to the East, visiting the hermits of
Egypt on his way, and finally settled at Bethlehem. His fame soon
drew around him a great company of monks. These he organized into
monasteries. He built a hospital, and established an inn for
travelers. Lacking the necessary funds to carry out his projects,
he dispatched his brother to the West with instructions to sell
what was left of his property, and the proceeds of this sale he
devoted to the cause. While in Bethlehem he wrote defences of
orthodoxy, eulogies of the dead, lives of saints and commentaries
on the Bible. He also completed his <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> translation of the Scriptures, and
wrote numerous letters to persons dwelling in various parts of the
empire.</p>
<p>Jerome rendered great service to monasticism by his literary
labors. He invested the dullest of lives with a halo of glory;
under the magic touch of his rhetoric the wilderness became a
gladsome place and the desert blossomed as the rose. His glowing
language transfigured the pale face and sunken eyes of the starved
hermit into features positively beautiful, while the rags that hung
loosely upon his emaciated frame became garments of lustrous white.
"Oh, that I could behold the desert," he cries, "lovelier than any
city! Oh, that I could see those lonely spots made into a paradise
by the saints that throng them!" Without detracting from the
bitterness of the prospect, he glorifies the courage that can face
the horrors of the desert, and the heart that can rejoice midst the
solitude of the seas. Hear him describe the home of Bonosus, a
hermit on an isle in the Adriatic:</p>
<p>"Bonosus, your friend, is now climbing the ladder foreshown in
Jacob's dream. He is bearing his cross, neither taking thought for
the morrow, nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>[pg
90]</span> looking back at what he has left. Here you have a youth,
educated with us in the refining accomplishments of the world, with
abundance of wealth and in rank inferior to none of his associates;
yet he forsakes his mother, his sister, and his dearly loved
brother, and settles like a new tiller of Eden on a dangerous
island, with the sea roaring round its reefs, while its rough
crags, bare rocks and desolate aspect make it more terrible
still.... He sees the glory of God which even the apostles saw not,
save in the desert. He beholds, it is true, no embattled towns, but
he has enrolled his name in the new city. Garments of sackcloth
disfigure his limbs, yet so he will the sooner be caught up to meet
Christ in the clouds. Round the entire island roars the frenzied
sea, while the beetling crags along its winding shores resound as
the billows beat against them. Precipitous cliffs surround his
dreadful abode as if it were a prison. He is careless, fearless,
armed from head to foot in the apostles' armor."</p>
<p>Listen to these trumpet tones as Jerome calls to a companion of
his youth in Rome: "O desert, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> enamelled with the flowers of Christ! O
retreat, which rejoicest in the friendship of God! What dost thou
in the world, my brother, with thy soul greater than the world? How
long wilt thou remain in the shadow of roofs, and in the smoky
dungeons of cities? Believe me, I see here more light."</p>
<p>To pass hastily over such appeals, coming from distant lands
across the sea to stir the minds of the thoughtful in Rome, is to
ignore one of the causes which produced the great exodus that
followed. He made men see that they were living in a moral Sodom,
and that if they would save their souls they must escape to the
desert. The power of personal influence, of inspiring private
letters, can hardly be overemphasized in studying the remarkable
progress of asceticism. Great awakenings in the moral, as in the
political or the social world, may be traced to the profound
influence of individuals, whose prophetic insight and moral
enthusiasm unfold the germ of the larger movements. There may be
widespread unrest, the ground may be prepared for the seed, but the
immediate cause of universal uprisings is the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> clarion call of
genius. Thus Luther's was the voice that cried in the wilderness,
inciting a vast host for whom centuries had been preparing.</p>
<p>But Jerome's fame as a man of learning, possessing a critical
taste and a classic style of rare beauty and simplicity, must not
blind us to the crowning glory of his brilliant career. He was
above all a spiritual force. His chief appeal was to the
conscience. He warmed the most torpid hearts by the fervor of his
love, and encouraged the most hopeless by his fiery zeal and heroic
faith. As a promoter of monasticism, he clashed with the interests
of an enfeebled clergy and a corrupt laity. Nothing could swerve
him from his course. False monks might draw terrible rebukes from
him, but the conviction that the soul could be delivered from
captivity to the body only by mortification remained unshaken. He
induced men to break the fetters of society that they might, under
the more favorable circumstances of solitude, wage war against
their unruly passions.</p>
<p>When parents objected to his monastic views, Jerome quoted the
saying of Jesus respecting the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> renunciation of father and mother, and
then said: "Though thy mother with flowing hair and rent garments,
should show thee the breasts which have nourished thee; though thy
father should lie upon the threshold; yet depart thou, treading
over thy father, and fly with dry eyes to the standard of the
cross. The love of God and the fear of hell easily rend the bonds
of the household asunder. The Holy Scripture indeed enjoins
obedience, but he who loves them more than Christ loses his
soul."</p>
<p>Jerome vividly portrays his own spiritual conflicts. The deserts
were crowded with saintly soldiers battling against similar
temptations, the nature of which is suggested by the following
excerpt from Jerome's writings: "How often," he says, "when I was
living in the desert, in the vast solitude which gives to hermits a
savage dwelling-place, parched by a burning sun, how often did I
fancy myself among the pleasures of Rome! I used to sit alone
because I was filled with bitterness. Sack-cloth disfigured my
unshapely limbs and my skin from long neglect had become black as
an Ethiopian's. Tears and groans were every day my portion; and if
drowsiness chanced to overcome <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> my struggles against it, my bare bones,
which hardly held together, clashed against the ground. Now
although in my fear of hell I had consigned myself to this prison
where I had no companions but scorpions and wild beasts, I often
found myself amid bevies of girls. Helpless, I cast myself at the
feet of Jesus, I watered them with my tears, and I subdued my
rebellious body with weeks of abstinence. I remember how I often
cried aloud all night till the break of day. I used to dread my
cell as if it knew my thoughts, and stern and angry with myself, I
used to make my way alone into the desert. Wherever I saw hollow
valleys, craggy mountains, steep cliffs, there I made my oratory;
there the house of correction for my unhappy flesh. There, also,
when I had shed copious tears and had strained my eyes to heaven, I
sometimes felt myself among angelic hosts and sang for joy and
gladness."</p>
<p>No doubt these men were warring against nature. Their yielding
to the temptation to obtain spiritual dominance by
self-flagellation and fasting may be criticized in the light of
modern Christianity. "Fanaticism defies nature," says F.W.
Robertson, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>[pg
95]</span> "Christianity refines it and respects it. Christianity
does not denaturalize, but only sanctifies and refines according to
the laws of nature. Christianity does not destroy our natural
instincts, but gives them a higher and nobler direction." To all
this I must assent, but, at the same time, I cannot but reverence
that pure passion for holiness which led men, despairing of
acquiring virtue in a degenerate age, to flee from the world and
undergo such torments to attain their soul's ideal. The form, the
method of their conflict was transient, the spirit and purpose
eternal. All honor to them for their magnificent and terrible
struggle, which has forever exalted the spiritual ideal, and
commanded men everywhere to seek first "the Kingdom of God and its
righteousness."</p>
<p>Jerome was always fond of the classics, although pagan writers
were not in favor with the early Christians. One night he dreamed
he was called to the skies where he was soundly flogged for reading
certain pagan authors. This vision interrupted his classical
studies for a time. In later years he resumed his beloved Virgil;
and he vigorously defended himself against those who charged him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> with
being a Pagan and an apostate on account of his love for Greek and
Roman literature. If his admiration for Virgil was the Devil's
work, I but give the Devil his due when I declare that much of the
charm of Jerome's literary productions is owing to the inspiration
of classic models.</p>
<p>Our attention must now be transferred from Jerome to the
high-born Roman matrons, who laid off their silks that they might
clothe themselves in the humble garb of the nun. As the narrative
proceeds I shall let Jerome speak as often as possible, that the
reader may become acquainted with the style of those biographies
and eulogies which were the talk of Rome, and which have been
admired so highly by succeeding generations.</p>
<p>Those who embraced monasticism in Rome did so in one of two
ways. Some sold their possessions, adopted coarse garments, and
subsisted on the plainest food, but they did not leave the city and
were still to be seen upon the streets. Jerome writes to
Pammachius: "Who would have believed that a last descendant of the
consuls, an ornament of the race of Camillus, could make up his
mind to traverse the city in the black robe of a monk, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span> and should not blush
to appear thus clad in the midst of senators." Some of those who
remained at Rome established a sort of retreat for their ascetic
friends.</p>
<p>But another class left Rome altogether. Some took up their abode
on the rugged isles of the Adriatic or the Mediterranean. Large
numbers of them went to the East, principally to Palestine. Jerome
was practically the abbot of a Roman colony of monks and nuns. Two
motives, beside the general ruling desire to achieve holiness,
produced this exodus to the Holy Land, which culminated centuries
later in the crusades. One was a desire to see the deserts and
caves, the abode of hermits famous for piety and miracles. Jerome,
as I have shown, invested these lonely retreats and strange
characters with a sort of holy romance, and hence, faith, mingled
with curiosity, led men to the East. Another motive was the desire
to visit the land of the Saviour, to tread the soil consecrated by
his labors of love, to live a life of poverty in the land where He
had no home He could call his own.</p>
<p>St. Paula was one of the women who left Rome and went to
Palestine. The story of her life is <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> told in a letter designed to comfort
her daughter Eustochium at the time of Paula's death. The epistle
begins: "If all the members of my body were to be converted into
tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a human
voice, I could still do no justice to the virtues of the holy and
venerable Paula. Of the stock of the Gracchi, descended from the
Scipios, she yet preferred Bethlehem to Rome, and left her palace
glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin." Her husband was of
royal blood and had died leaving her five children. At his death,
she gave herself to works of charity. The poor and sick she wrapped
in her own blankets. She began to tire of the receptions and other
social duties which her position entailed upon her. While in this
frame of mind, two Eastern bishops were entertained at her home
during a gathering of ecclesiastics. They seem to have imparted the
monastic impulse, perhaps by the rehearsal of monastic tales, for
we are informed that at this time she determined to leave servants,
property and children, in order to embrace the monastic life.</p>
<p>Let us stand with her children and kinsfolk on the shore of the
sea as they take their final farewell <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> of Paula. "The sails
were set and the strokes of the rowers carried the vessel into the
deep. On the shore little Toxotius stretched forth his hands in
entreaty, while Rufina, now grown up, with silent sobs besought her
mother to wait until she should be married. But still Paula's eyes
were dry as she turned them heavenwards, and she overcame her love
for her children by her love for God. She knew herself no more as a
mother that she might approve herself a handmaid of Christ. Yet her
heart was rent within her, and she wrestled with her grief as
though she were being forcibly separated from parts of herself. The
greatness of the affection she had to overcome made all admire her
victory the more. Though it is against the laws of nature, she
endured this trial with unabated faith."</p>
<p>So the vessel ploughed onward, carrying the mother who thought
she was honoring God and attaining the true end of being through
ruthless strangling of maternal love. She visited Syria and Egypt
and the islands of Ponta and Cyprus. At the feet of the hermit
fathers she begged their blessing and tried to emulate the virtues
she <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
believed they possessed. At Jerusalem she fell upon her face and
kissed the stone before the sepulcher. "What tears, she shed, what
groans she uttered, what grief she poured out all Jerusalem
knows!"</p>
<p>She established two monasteries at Bethlehem, one of which was
for women. Here, with her daughter, she lived a life of rigid
abstinence. Her nuns had nothing they could call their own. If they
paid too much attention to dress Paula said, "A clean body and a
clean dress mean an unclean soul." To her credit, she was more
lenient with others than with herself. Jerome admits she went to
excess, and prudently observes: "Difficult as it is to avoid
extremes, the philosophers are quite right in their opinion that
virtue is a mean and vice an excess, or, as we may express it in
one short sentence, in nothing too much." Paula swept floors and
toiled in the kitchen. She slept on the ground, covered by a mat of
goat's hair. Her weeping was incessant. As she meditated over the
Scriptures, her tears fell so profusely that her sight was
endangered. Jerome warned her to spare her eyes, but she said: "I
must disfigure that face <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> which, contrary to God's commandment,
I have painted with rouge, white lead and antimony." If this be a
sin against the Almighty, bear witness, O ye daughters of Eve! Her
love for the poor continued to be the motive of her great
liberality. In fact, her giving knew no bounds. Fuller wisely
remarks that "liberality must have banks as well as a stream;" but
Paula said: "My prayer is that I may die a beggar, leaving not a
penny to my daughter and indebted to strangers for my winding
sheet." Her petition was literally granted, for she died leaving
her daughter not only without a penny but overwhelmed in a mass of
debts.</p>
<p>As Jerome approaches the description of Paula's death, he says:
"Hitherto the wind has all been in my favor and my keel has
smoothly ploughed through the heaving sea. But now my bark is
running upon the rocks, the billows are mountain high, and imminent
shipwreck awaits me." Yet Paula, like David, must go the way of all
the earth. Surrounded by her followers chanting psalms, she
breathed her last. An immense concourse of people attended her
funeral. Not a single monk lingered in his cell. Thus, the twenty
hard years <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>[pg
102]</span> of self-torture for this Roman lady of culture ended in
the rest of the grave.</p>
<p>Upon her tombstone was placed this significant inscription:</p>
<blockquote>"Within this tomb a child of Scipio lies,<br>
A daughter of the far-famed Pauline house,<br>
A scion of the Gracchi, of the stock<br>
Of Agamemnon's self, illustrious:<br>
Here rests the lady Paula, well beloved<br>
Of both her parents, with Eustochium<br>
For daughter; she the first of Roman dames<br>
Who hardship chose and Bethlehem for Christ."</blockquote>
<p>Another interesting character of that period was Marcella, a
beautiful woman of illustrious lineage, a descendant of consuls and
prefects. After a married life of seven years her husband died. She
determined not to embark on the matrimonial seas a second time, but
to devote herself to works of charity. Cerealis, an old man, but of
consular rank, offered her his fortune that he might consider her
less his wife than his daughter. "Had I a wish to marry," was her
noble reply, "I should look for a husband and not for an
inheritance." Disdaining all enticements to remain in society, she
began her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[pg
103]</span> monastic career with joy and turned her home into a
retreat for women who, like herself, wished to retire from the
world. It is not known just what rules governed their relations,
but they employed the time in moderate fasting, prayers and
alms-giving.</p>
<p>Marcella lavished her wealth upon the poor. Jerome praises her
philanthropic labors thus: "Our widow's clothing was meant to keep
out the cold and not to show her figure. She stored her money in
the stomachs of the poor rather than to keep it at her own
disposal." Seldom seen upon the streets, she remained at home,
surrounded by virgins and widows, obedient and loving to her
mother. Among the high-born women it was regarded as degrading to
assume the costume of the nun, but she bore the scorn of her social
equals with humility and grace.</p>
<p>This quiet and useful life was rudely and abruptly ended by a
dreadful catastrophe. Alaric the Goth had seized and sacked Rome.
The world stood aghast. The sad news reached Jerome in his cell at
Bethlehem, who expressed his sorrow in forceful language: "My voice
sticks in my throat; and as <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> I dictate, sobs choke my utterance.
The city which has taken the whole world is itself taken." Rude
barbarians invaded the sanctity of Marcella's retreat. They
demanded her gold, but she pointed to the coarse dress she wore to
show them she had no buried treasures. They did not believe her,
and cruelly beat her with cudgels. A few days after the saintly
heroine of righteousness went to her long home to enjoy
richly-merited rest and peace.</p>
<blockquote>"Who can describe the carnage of that night?<br>
What tears are equal to its agony?<br>
Of ancient date a sovran city falls;<br>
And lifeless in its streets and houses lie<br>
Unnumbered bodies of its citizens.<br>
In many a ghastly shape doth death appear."</blockquote>
<p>Marcella and her monastic home fell in the general ruin, but in
the words of Horace, she left "a monument more enduring than
brass." Her noble life, so full of kind words and loving deeds,
still stirs the hearts of her sisters who, while they may reject
her ascetic ideal, will, nevertheless, try to emulate her noble
spirit. As Jerome said of Paula: "By shunning glory she earned
glory; for glory follows virtue as its shadow; and deserting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> those
who seek it, it seeks those who despise it."</p>
<p>Still another woman claims our attention,--Fabiola, the founder
of the first hospital. Lecky declares that "the first public
hospital and the charity planted by that woman's hand overspread
the world, and will alleviate to the end of time the darkest
anguish of humanity." She, too, was a widow who refused to marry
again, but broke up her home, sold her possessions, and with the
proceeds founded a hospital into which were gathered the sick from
the streets. She nursed the sufferers and washed their ulcers and
wounds. No task was beneath her, no sacrifice of personal comfort
too great for her love. Many helped her with their gold, but she
gave herself. She also aided in establishing a home for strangers
at Portus, which became one of the most famous inns of the time.
Travelers from all parts of the world found a welcome and a shelter
on landing at this port. When she died the roofs of Rome were
crowded with those who watched the funeral procession. Psalms were
chanted, and the gilded ceilings of the churches resounded to the
music in commendation of her loving life and labors.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
<p>These and other characters of like zeal and fortitude exemplify
the spirit of the men and women who interested the West in
monasticism. Much as their errors and extravagances may be
deplored, there is no question that some of them were types of the
loftiest Christian virtues, inspired by the most laudable
motives.</p>
<p>Noble and true are Kingsley's words: "We may blame those ladies,
if we will, for neglecting their duties. We may sneer, if we will,
at their weaknesses, the aristocratic pride, the spiritual vanity,
we fancy we discover. We must confess that in these women the
spirit of the old Roman matrons, which seemed to have been dead so
long, flashed up for one splendid moment ere it sank into the
darkness of the middle ages."</p>
<br>

<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="Monasticism_and_Women"></a>Monasticism and
Women</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The origin of nunneries was coeval with that of monasteries, and
the history of female recluses runs parallel to that of the men.
Almost every male order had its counterpart in some sort of a
sisterhood. The general moral character of these female
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
associations was higher than that of the male organizations. I have
confined my treatment in this work to the monks, but a few words
may be said at this point concerning female ascetics.</p>
<p>Hermit life was unsuited to women, but we know that at a very
early date many of them retired to the seclusion of convent life.
It will be recalled that in the biography of St. Anthony, before
going into the desert he placed his sister in the care of some
virgins who were living a life of abstinence, apart from society.
It is very doubtful if any uniform rule governed these first
religious houses, or if definitely organized societies appear much
before the time of Benedict. The variations in the monastic order
among the men were accompanied by similar changes in the
associations of women.</p>
<p>The history of these sisterhoods discloses three interesting and
noteworthy facts that merit brief mention:</p>
<p>First, the effect of a corrupt society upon women. As in the
case of men, women were moved to forsake their social duties
because they were weary of the sensual and aimless life of Rome.
Those <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
were the days of elaborate toilettes, painted faces and blackened
eyelids, of intrigues and foolish babbling. Venial faults--it may
be thought--innocent displays of tender frailty; but woman's nature
demands loftier employments. A great soul craves occupations and
recognizes obligations more in harmony with the true nobility of
human nature. Rome had no monitor of the higher life until the
monks came with their stories of heroic self-abnegation and
unselfish toil. The women felt the force and truth of Jerome's
criticism of their trifling follies when he said: "Do not seek to
appear over-eloquent, nor trifle with verse, nor make yourself gay
with lyric songs. And do not, out of affectation, follow the sickly
taste of married ladies, who now pressing their teeth together, now
keeping their lips wide apart, speak with a lisp, and purposely
clip their words, because they fancy that to pronounce them
naturally is a mark of country breeding."</p>
<p>Professor Dill is inclined to discount the testimony of Jerome
respecting the morals of Roman society. He thinks Jerome
exaggerated the perils surrounding women. He says: "The truth is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> Jerome
is not only a monk but an artist in words; and his horror of evil,
his vivid imagination, and his passion for literary effect,
occasionally carry him beyond the region of sober fact. There was
much to amend in the morals of the Roman world. But we must not
take the leader of a great moral reformation as a cool and
dispassionate observer." But this observation amounts to nothing
more than a cautionary word against mistaking evils common to all
times for special symptoms of excessive immorality. Professor Dill
practically concedes the truthfulness of contemporary witnesses,
including Jerome, when he says: "Yet, after all allowances, the
picture is not a pleasant one. We feel that we are far away from
the simple, unworldly devotion of the freedmen and obscure toilers
whose existence was hardly known to the great world before the age
of the Antonines, and who lived in the spirit of the Sermon on the
Mount and in constant expectation of the coming of their Lord. The
triumphant Church, which has brought Paganism to its knees, is very
different from the Church of the catacombs and the persecutions."
The picture which Jerome draws of the Roman women <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span> is indeed
repulsive, and Professor Dill would gladly believe it to be
exaggerated, but, nevertheless, he thinks that "if the priesthood,
with its enormous influence, was so corrupt, it is only probable
that it debased the sex which is always most under clerical
influence."</p>
<p>But far graver charges cling to the memories of the Roman women.
Crime darkened every household. The Roman lady was cruel and
impure. She delighted in the blood of gladiators and in illicit
love. Roman law at this time permitted women to hold and to control
large estates, and it became a fad for these patrician ladies to
marry poor men, so that they might have their husbands within their
power. All sorts of alliances could then be formed, and if their
husbands remonstrated, they, holding the purse strings, were able
to say: "If you don't like it you can leave." A profligate himself,
the husband usually kept his counsel, and as a reward, dwelt in a
palace. "When the Roman matrons became the equal and voluntary
companions of their lords," says Gibbon, "a new jurisprudence was
introduced, that marriage, like other partnerships, might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
dissolved by the abdication of one of the associates." I have but
touched the fringe of a veil I will not lift; but it is easy to
understand why those women who cherished noble sentiments welcomed
the monastic life as a pathway of escape from scenes and customs
from which their better natures recoiled in horror.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fine quality of mercy that distinguishes woman's
character deserves recognition. Even though she retired to a
convent, she could not become so forgetful of her fellow creatures
as her male companions. From the very beginning we observe that she
was more unselfish in her asceticism than they. It is true the monk
forsook all, and to that extent was self-sacrificing, but in his
desire for his own salvation, he was prone to neglect every one
else. The monk's ministrations were too often confined to those who
came to him, but the nun went forth to heal the diseased and to
bind up the broken-hearted. As soon as she embraced the monastic
life we read of hospitals. The desire for salvation drove man into
the desert; a Christ-like mercy and divine sympathy kept his sister
by the couch of pain.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
<p>Lastly, a word remains to be said touching the question of
marriage. At first, the nun sometimes entered the marriage state,
and, of course, left the convent; but, beginning with Basil, this
practice was condemned, and irrevocable vows were exacted. In 407,
Innocent I. closed even the door of penitence and forgiveness to
those who broke their vows and married.</p>
<p>Widows and virgins alike assumed the veil. Marriage itself was
not despised, because the monastic life was only for those who
sought a higher type of piety than, it was supposed, could be
attained amid the ordinary conditions of life. But marriage, as
well as other so-called secular relations, was eschewed by those
who wished to make their salvation sure. Jerome says: "I praise
wedlock, I praise marriage, but it is because they give me virgins;
I gather the rose from the thorns, the gold from the earth, the
pearl from the shell." He therefore tolerated marriage among people
contented with ordinary religious attainments, but he thought it
incompatible with true holiness. Augustine admitted that the mother
and her daughter may be both in heaven, but one a bright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> and the
other a dim star. Some writers, as Helvidius, opposed this view and
maintained that there was no special virtue in an unmarried life;
that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was also the mother of other
children, and as such was an example of Christian virtue. Jerome
brought out his guns and poured hot shot into the enemies' camp. In
the course of his answer, which contained many intolerant and
acrimonious statements, he drew a comparison between the married
and the unmarried state. It is interesting because it reflects the
opinions of those who disparaged marriage, and reveals the
character of the principles which the early Fathers advocated. It
is very evident from this letter against Helvidius that Jerome
regarded all secular duties as interfering with the pursuit of the
highest virtue.</p>
<p>"Do you think," he says, "there is no difference between one who
spends her time in prayer and fasting, and one who must, at her
husband's approach, make up her countenance, walk with a mincing
gait, and feign a show of endearment? The virgin aims to appear
less comely; she will wrong herself so as to hide her natural
attractions. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>[pg
114]</span> The married woman has the paint laid on before her
mirror, and, to the insult of her Maker, strives to acquire
something more than her natural beauty. Then come the prattling of
infants, the noisy household, children watching for her word and
waiting for her kiss, the reckoning up of expenses, the preparation
to meet the outlay. On one side you will see a company of cooks,
girded for the onslaught and attacking the meat; there you may hear
the hum of a multitude of weavers. Meanwhile a message is delivered
that her husband and his friends have arrived. The wife, like a
swallow, flies all over the house. She has to see to everything. Is
the sofa smooth? Is the pavement swept? Are the flowers in the cup?
Is dinner ready? Tell me, pray, amid all this, is there room for
the thought of God?"</p>
<p>Such was Roman married life as it appeared to Jerome. The very
duties and blessings that we consider the glory of the family he
despised. I will return to his views later, but it is interesting
to note the absence at this period, of the modern and true idea
that God may be served in the performance of household and other
secular duties. Women fled <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> from such occupations in those days
that they might be religious. The disagreeable fact of Peter's
marriage was overcome by the assertion that he must have washed
away the stain of his married life by the blood of his martyrdom.
Such extreme views arose partly as a reaction from and a protest
against the dominant corruption, a state of affairs in which happy
and holy marriages were rare.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Spread_of_Monasticism_in_Europe"></a>The Spread
of Monasticism in Europe</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Much more might be said of monastic life in Rome, were it not
now necessary to treat of the spread of monasticism in Europe.
There are many noble characters whom we ought to know, such as
Ambrose, one of Christendom's greatest bishops, who led a life of
poverty and strict abstinence, like his sister Marcella, whom we
have met. He it was, of whom the Emperor Theodosius said: "I have
met a man who has told me the truth." Well might he so declare, for
Ambrose refused him admission to the church at Milan, because his
hands were red with the blood of the murdered, and succeeded in
persuading him to submit to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> discipline. To Ambrose may be applied
the words which Gibbon wrote of Gregory Nazianzen: "The title of
Saint has been added to his name, but the tenderness of his heart
and the elegance of his genius reflect a more pleasing luster on
his memory."</p>
<p>The story of John, surnamed Chrysostom, who was born at Antioch,
in 347, is exceedingly interesting. He was a young lawyer, who
entered the priesthood after his baptism. He at once set his heart
on the monastic life, but his mother took him to her chamber, and,
by the bed where she had given him birth, besought him in fear, not
to forsake her. "My son," she said in substance, "my only comfort
in the midst of the miseries of this earthly life is to see thee
constantly, and to behold in thy traits the faithful image of my
beloved husband, who is no more. When you have buried me and joined
my ashes with those of your father, nothing will then prevent you
from retiring into the monastic life. But so long as I breathe,
support me by your presence, and do not draw down upon you the
wrath of God by bringing such evils upon me who have given you no
offence." This <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>[pg
117]</span> singularly tender petition was granted, but Chrysostom
turned his home into a monastery, slept on the bare floor, ate
little and seldom, and prayed much by day and by night.</p>
<p>After his mother's death Chrysostom enjoyed the seclusion of a
monastic solitude for six years, but impairing his health by
excessive self-mortification he returned to Antioch in 380. He
rapidly rose to a position of commanding influence in the church.
His peerless oratorical and literary gifts were employed in
elevating the ascetic ideal and in unsparing denunciations of the
worldly religion of the imperial court. He incurred the furious
hatred of the young and beautiful Empress Eudoxia, who united her
influence with that of the ambitious Theophilus, patriarch of
Alexandria, and Chrysostom was banished from Constantinople, but
died on his way to the remote desert of Pityus. His powerful
sermons and valuable writings contributed in no small degree to the
spread of monasticism among the Christians of his time.</p>
<p>Then there was Augustine, the greatest thinker since Plato. "We
shall meet him," says Schaff, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> "alike on the broad highways and the
narrow foot-paths, on the giddy Alpine heights and in the awful
depths of speculation, wherever philosophical thinkers before him
or after him have trod." He, too, like all the other leaders of
thought in his time, was ascetic in his habits. Although he lived
and labored for thirty-eight years at Hippo, a Numidian city about
two hundred miles west of Carthage, in Africa, Augustine was
regarded as the intellectual head not only of North Africa but of
Western Christianity. He gathered his clergy into a college of
priests, with a community of goods, thus approaching as closely to
the regular monastic life as was possible to secular clergymen. He
established religious houses and wrote a set of rules, consisting
of twenty-four articles, for the government of monasteries. These
rules were superseded by those of Benedict, but they were
resuscitated under Charlemagne and reappeared in the famous Austin
Canons of the eleventh century. Little did Augustine think that a
thousand years later an Augustinian monk--Luther--would abandon his
order to become the founder of modern Protestantism.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>
<p>Augustine published a celebrated essay,--"On the Labor of
Monks,"--in which he pointed out the dangers of monachism,
condemned its abuses, and ended by sighing for the quiet life of
the monk who divided his day between labor, reading and prayer,
whilst he himself spent his years amid the noisy throng and the
perplexities of his episcopate.</p>
<p>These men, and many others, did much to further monasticism. But
we must now leave sunny Africa and journey northward through Gaul
into the land of the hardy Britons and Scots.</p>
<p>Athanasius, the same weary exile whom we have encountered in
Egypt and in Rome, had been banished by Constantine to Treves, in
336. In 346 and 349 he again visited Gaul. He told the same story
of Anthony and the Egyptian hermits with similar results.</p>
<p>The most renowned ecclesiastic of the Gallican church, whose
name is most intimately associated with the spread of monasticism
in Western Europe, before the days of Benedict, was Saint Martin of
Tours. He lived about the years 316-396 A.D. The chronicle of his
life is by no means trustworthy, but that is essential neither to
popularity <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[pg
120]</span> nor saintship. Only let a Severus describe his life and
miracles in glowing rhetoric and fantastic legend and the people
will believe it, pronouncing him greatest among the great, the
mightiest miracle-worker of that miracle-working age.</p>
<p>Martin was a soldier three years, against his will, under
Constantine. One bleak winter day he cut his white military coat in
two with his sword and clothed a beggar with half of it. That night
he heard Jesus address the angels: "Martin, as yet only a
catechumen has clothed me with his garment." After leaving the army
he became a hermit, and, subsequently, bishop of Tours. He lived
for years just outside of Tours in a cell made of interlaced
branches. His monks dwelt around him in caves cut out of scarped
rocks, overlooking a beautiful stream. They were clad in camel's
hair and lived on a diet of brown bread, sleeping on a straw
couch.</p>
<p>But Martin's monks did not take altogether kindly to their mode
of life. Severus records an amusing story of their rebellion
against the meager allowance of food. The Egyptian could exist on a
few figs a day. But these rude Gauls, just emerging <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> out of barbarism,
were accustomed to devour great slices of roasted meat and to drink
deep draughts of beer. Such sturdy children of the northern forests
naturally disdained dainty morsels of barley bread and small
potations of wine. True, Athanasius had said, "Fasting is the food
of angels," but these ascetic novices, in their perplexity, could
only say: "We are accused of gluttony; but we are Gauls; it is
ridiculous and cruel to make us live like angels; we are not
angels; once more, we are only Gauls." Their complaint comes down
to us as a pathetic but humorous protest of common sense against
ascetic fanaticism; or, regarded in another light, it may be
considered as additional evidence of the depravity of the natural
man.</p>
<p>In spite of all complaints, however, Martin did not abate the
severity of his discipline. As a bishop he pushed his monastic
system into all the surrounding country. His zeal knew no bounds,
and his strength seemed inexhaustible. "No one ever saw him either
gloomy or merry," remarks his biographer. Amid many embarrassments
and difficulties he was ever the same, with a countenance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> full of
heavenly serenity. He was a great miracle-worker--that is, if
everything recorded of him is true. He cast out demons, and healed
the sick; he had strange visions of angels and demons, and,
wonderful to relate, thrice he raised bodies from the dead.</p>
<p>But all conquerors are at last vanquished by the angel of death,
and Martin passed into the company of the heavenly host and the
category of saints. Two thousand monks attended his funeral. His
fame spread all over Europe. Tradition tells us he was the uncle of
Saint Patrick of Ireland. Churches were dedicated to him in France,
Germany, Scotland and England. The festival of his birth is
celebrated on the eleventh of November. In Scotland this day still
marks the winter term, which is called Martinmas. Saint Martin's
shrine was one of the most famous of the middle ages, and was noted
for its wonderful cures. No saint is held, even now, in higher
veneration by the French Catholic.</p>
<p>It is not known when the institution was planted in Spain, but
in 380 the council of Saragossa forbade priests to assume monkish
habits. Germany <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>[pg
123]</span> received the institution some time in the fifth
century. The introduction of Christianity as well as of monasticism
into the British Isles is shrouded in darkness. A few jewels of
fact may be gathered from the legendary rubbish. It is probable
that before the days of Benedict, Saint Patrick, independently of
Rome, established monasteries in Ireland and preached the gospel
there; and, without doubt, before the birth of Benedict of Nursia,
there were monks and monasteries in Great Britain. The monastery of
Bangor is said to have been founded about 450 A.D.</p>
<p>It is probable that Christianity was introduced into Britain
before the close of the second century, and that monasticism arose
some time in the fifth century. Tertullian, about the beginning of
the third century, boasts that Christianity had conquered places in
Britain where the Roman arms could not penetrate. Origen claimed
that the power of the Savior was manifest in Britain as well as in
Muritania. The earliest notice we have of a British church occurs
in the writings of the Venerable Bede (673-735 A.D.), a monk whose
numerous and valuable works on English history <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> entitle him to the
praise of being "the greatest literary benefactor this or any other
nation has produced." He informs us that a British
king--Lucius--embraced Christianity during the reign of the Emperor
Aurelius, and that missionaries were sent from Rome to Britain
about that time. Lingard says the story is suspicious, since "we
know not from what source Bede, at the distance of five centuries,
derived his information." It seems quite likely that there must
have been some Christians among the Roman soldiers or civil
officials who lived in Britain during the Roman occupation of the
country. The whole problem has been the theme of so much
controversy, however, that a fuller discussion is reserved for the
next chapter.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Disorders_and_Oppositions"></a>Disorders and
Oppositions</i></h2>
<br>
<p>But was there no protest against the progress of these ascetic
teachings? Did the monastic institution command the unanimous
approval of the church from the outset? There were many and strong
outcries against the monks, but they were <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> quickly silenced by
the counter-shouts of praise. Even when rebellion against the
system seemed formidable, it was popular nevertheless. The lifted
hand was quickly struck down, and voices of opposition suddenly
hushed. Like a mighty flood the movement swept on,--kings, when so
inclined, being powerless to stop it. As Paula was carried fainting
from the funeral procession of Bl&aelig;silla, her daughter,
whispers such as these were audible in the crowd: "Is not this what
we have often said? She weeps for her daughter, killed with
fasting. How long must we refrain from driving these detestable
monks out of Rome? Why do we not stone them or hurl them into the
Tiber? They have misled this unhappy mother; that she is not a nun
from choice is clear. No heathen mother ever wept for her children
as she does for Bl&aelig;silla." And this is Paula, who, choked
with grief, refused to weep when she sailed from her children for
the far East!</p>
<p>Unhappily, history is often too dignified to retail the
conversations of the dinner-table and the gossip of private life.
But this narrative indicates that in many a Roman family the monk
was feared, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>[pg
126]</span> despised and hated. Sometimes everyday murmurs found
their way into literature and so passed to posterity. Rutilius, the
Pagan poet, as he sails before a hermit isle in the Mediterranean,
exclaims: "Behold, Capraria rises before us; that isle is full of
wretches, enemies of light. I detest these rocks scene of a recent
shipwreck." He then goes on to declare that a young and rich
friend, impelled by the furies, had fled from men and gods to a
living tomb, and was now decaying in that foul retreat. This was no
uncommon opinion. But contrast it with what Ambrose said of those
same isles: "It is there in these isles, thrown down by God like a
collar of pearls upon the sea, that those who would escape from the
charms of dissipation find refuge. Nothing here disturbs their
peace, all access is closed to the wild passions of the world. The
mysterious sound of waves mingles with the chant of hymns; and,
while the waters break upon the shores of these happy isles with a
gentle murmur, the peaceful accents of the choir of the elect
ascend toward Heaven from their bosom." No wonder the Milanese
ladies guarded their daughters against this theological poet.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
<p>Even among the Christians there were hostile as well as friendly
critics of monasticism; Jovinian, whom Neander compares to Luther,
is a type of the former. Although a monk himself, he disputed the
thesis that any merit lay in celibacy, fasting or poverty. He
opposed the worship of saints and relics, and believed that one
might retain possession of his property and make good use of it. He
assailed the dissolute monks and claimed that many of Rome's
noblest young men and women were withdrawn from a life of
usefulness into the desert. He held that there was really but one
class of Christians, namely, those who had faith in Christ, and
that a monk could be no more. But Jovinian was far in advance of
his age, and it was many years before the truth of his view gained
any considerable recognition. He was severely attacked by Jerome,
who called him a Christian Epicurean, and was condemned as a
heretic by a synod at Milan, in 390. Thus the reformers were
crushed for centuries. The Pagan Emperor, Julian, and the
Christian, Valens, alike tried in vain to resist the emigration
into the desert. Thousands fled, in times of peril to the state,
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
their civil and military duties, but the emperors were powerless to
prevent the exodus.</p>
<p>That there were grounds for complaint against the monks we may
know from the charges made even by those who favored the system.
Jerome Ambrose, Augustine, and in fact almost every one of the
Fathers tried to correct the growing disorders. We learn from them
that many fled from society, not to become holy, but to escape
slavery and famine; and that many were lazy and immoral. Their
"shaven heads lied to God." Avarice, ambition, or cowardice ruled
hearts that should have been actuated by a love of poverty,
self-sacrifice or courage. "Quite recently," says Jerome, "we have
seen to our sorrow a fortune worthy of Croesus brought to light by
a monk's death, and a city's alms collected for the poor, left by
will to his sons and successors."</p>
<p>Many monks traveled from place to place selling sham relics.
Augustine wrote against "those hypocrites who, in the dress of
monks, wander about the provinces carrying pretended relics,
amulets, preservatives, and expecting alms to feed their lucrative
poverty and recompense their <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> pretended virtue." It is to the
credit of the Fathers of the church that they boldly and earnestly
rebuked the vices of the monks and tried to purge the monastic
system of its impurities.</p>
<p>But the church sanctioned the monastic movement. She could not
have done anything else. "It is one of the most striking
occurrences in history," says Harnack, "that the church, exactly at
the time when she was developing more and more into a legal
institution and a sacramental establishment, outlined a Christian
life-ideal which was incapable of realization within her bounds,
but only alongside of her. The more she affiliated herself with the
world, the higher and more superhuman did she make her ideal."</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that this "life-ideal" seems to have led,
inevitably, to fanaticism and other excesses, so that even at this
early date there was much occasion for alarm. Gross immorality was
disclosed as well as luminous purity; indolence and laziness as
well as the love of sacrifice and toil. So we shall find it down
through the centuries. "The East had few great men," says Milman,
"many madmen; the West, madmen <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> enough, but still very many, many
great men." We have met some madmen and some great men. We shall
meet more of each type.</p>
<p>After 450 A.D., monasticism suffered an eclipse for over half a
century. It seemed as if the Western institution was destined to
end in that imbecility and failure which overtook the Eastern
system. But there came a man who infused new life into the monastic
body. He systematized its scattered principles and concentrated the
energies of the wandering and unorganized monks.</p>
<p>Our next visit will be to the mountain home of this renowned
character, fifty miles to the west of Rome. "A single monk," says
Montalembert, "is about to form there a center of spiritual virtue,
and to light it up with a splendor destined to shine over
regenerated Europe for ten centuries to come."</p>

<h2><a name="III"></a>III</h2>
<h2><i><a name="THE_BENEDICTINES"></a>THE BENEDICTINES</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Saint Benedict, the founder of the famous monastic order that
bears his name, was born at Nursia, about 480 A.D. His parents, who
were wealthy, intended to give him a liberal education; but their
plans were defeated, for at fifteen years of age Benedict renounced
his family and fortune, and fled from his school life in Rome. The
vice of the city shocked and disgusted him. He would rather be
ignorant and holy, than educated and wicked. On his way into the
mountains, he met a monk named Romanus,--the spot is marked by the
chapel of Santa Crocella,--who gave him a haircloth shirt and a
monastic dress of skins. Continuing his journey with Romanus, the
youthful ascetic discovered a sunless cave in the desert of
Subiaco, about forty miles from Rome. Into this <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> cell he climbed,
and in it he lived three years. It was so inaccessible that Romanus
had to lower his food to him by a rope, to which was attached a
bell to call him from his devotions. Once the Devil threw a stone
at the rope and broke it.</p>
<p>But Benedict's bodily escape from the wickedness of Rome did not
secure his spiritual freedom. "There was a certain lady of thin,
airy shape, who was very active in this solemnity; her name was
Fancy." Time and again, he revisited his old haunts, borne on the
wings of his imagination. The face of a beautiful young girl of
previous acquaintance constantly appeared before him. He was about
to yield to the temptation and to return, when, summoning all his
strength, he made one mighty effort to dispel the illusion forever.
Divesting himself of his clothes, he rolled his naked body among
the thorn-bushes near his cave. It was drastic treatment, but it
seems to have rid his mind effectually of disturbing fancies. This
singular self-punishment was used by Godric, the Welsh saint, in
the twelfth century. "Failing to subdue his rebellious flesh by
this method, he buried a cask in the earthen floor of his cell,
filled it with water <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> and fitted it with a cover, and in
this receptacle he shut himself up whenever he felt the
titillations of desire. In this manner, varied by occasionally
passing the night up to his chin in a river, of which he had broken
the ice, he finally succeeded in mastering his fiery nature."</p>
<p>One day some peasants discovered Benedict at the entrance of his
cave. Deceived by his savage appearance, they mistook him for a
wild beast, but the supposed wolf proving to be a saint, they fell
down and reverenced him.</p>
<p>The fame of the young ascetic attracted throngs of hermits, who
took up their abodes near his cell. After a time monasteries were
established, and Benedict was persuaded to become an abbot in one
of them. His strictness provoked much opposition among the monks,
resulting in carefully-laid plots to compass the moral ruin of
their spiritual guide. An attempt to poison him was defeated by a
miraculous interposition, and Benedict escaped to a solitary
retreat.</p>
<p>Again the moral hero became an abbot, and again the severity of
his discipline was resented. This time a wicked and jealous priest
sought to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>[pg
134]</span> entrap the saint by turning into a garden in which he
was accustomed to walk seven young girls of exquisite physical
charms. When Benedict encountered this temptation, he fled from the
scene and retired to a picturesque mountain--the renowned Monte
Cassino. Let Montalembert describe this celebrated spot among the
western Apennines: "At the foot of this rock Benedict found an
amphitheatre of the time of the C&aelig;sars, amidst the ruins of
the town of Casinum, which the most learned and pious of Romans,
Varro, that pagan Benedictine, whose memory and knowledge the sons
of Benedict took pleasure in honoring, had rendered illustrious.
From the summit the prospect extended on one side towards Arpinum,
where the prince of Roman orators was born, and on the other
towards Aquinum, already celebrated as the birthplace of
Juvenal.... It was amidst those noble recollections, this solemn
nature, and upon that predestinated height, that the patriarch of
the monks of the West founded the capital of the monastic
order."</p>
<p>In the year 529 a great stronghold of Paganism in these wild
regions gave way to Benedict's faith. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> Upon the ruins of a
temple to Apollo, and in a grove sacred to Venus, arose the model
of Western monasticism,--the cloister of Monte Cassino, which was
to shine resplendent for a thousand years. The limitations of my
purpose will prevent me from following in detail the fortunes of
this renowned retreat, but it may not be out of place to glance at
its subsequent history.</p>
<p>Monte Cassino is located three and a half miles to the northeast
of the town of Cassino, midway between Rome and Naples. About 589
A.D. the Lombards destroyed the buildings, but the monks escaped to
Rome, in fulfilment, so it is claimed, of a prophecy uttered by
Benedict. It lay in ruins until restored by Gregory II. in 719,
only to be burned in 884 by the Saracens; seventy years later it
was again rebuilt. It afterwards passed through a variety of
calamities, and was consecrated, for the third time, by Benedict
XII., in 1729. Longfellow quotes a writer for the <i>London Daily
News</i> as saying: "There is scarcely a pope or emperor of
importance who has not been personally connected with its history.
From its mountain crag it has seen Goths, Lombards, Saracens,
Normans, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>[pg
136]</span> Frenchmen, Spaniards, Germans, scour and devastate the
land which, through all modern history, has attracted every
invader."</p>
<p>It was enriched by popes, emperors and princes. In its palmy
days the abbot was the first baron in the realm, and commanded over
four hundred towns and villages. In 1866, it shared the fate of all
the monasteries of Italy. It still stands upon the summit of the
mountain, and can be seen by the traveler from the railway in the
valley. At present it serves as a Catholic seminary with about two
hundred students. It contains a spacious church, richly ornamented
with marble, mosaics and paintings. It has also a famous library
which, in spite of bad usage, is still immensely valuable.
Boccaccio made a visit to the place, and when he saw the precious
books so vilely mutilated, he departed in tears, exclaiming: "Now,
therefore, O scholar, rack thy brains in the making of books!" The
library contains about twenty thousand volumes, and about
thirty-five thousand popes' bulls, diplomas and charters. There are
also about a thousand manuscripts, some of which are of priceless
value, as they date from the sixth century downward, and consist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> of
ancient Bibles and important medieval literature.</p>
<p>Benedict survived the founding of this monastery fourteen years.
His time was occupied in establishing other cloisters, perfecting
his rule, and preaching. Many stories are related of his power over
the hearts of the untamed barbarians. Galea the Goth, out on a
marauding expedition, demanded a peasant to give him his treasures.
The peasant, thinking to escape, said he had committed them to the
keeping of Benedict. Galea immediately ordered him to be bound on a
horse and conducted to the saint. Benedict was seated at the
gateway reading when Galea and his prisoner arrived. Looking up
from his book he fastened his eyes upon the poor peasant, who was
immediately loosed from his bonds. The astonished Galea, awed by
this miracle, fell at the feet of the abbot, and, instead of
demanding gold, supplicated his blessing. Once a boy was drowning,
and, at the command of Benedict, St. Maur, a wealthy young Roman,
who had turned monk, walked safely out upon the water and rescued
the lad. Gregory also tells us many stories of miraculous healing,
and of one resurrection from the dead.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>
<p>Benedict's last days were linked with a touching incident. His
sister, Scholastica, presided over a convent near his own. They met
once a year. On his last visit to her, Scholastica begged him to
remain and "speak of the joys of Heaven till the morning." But
Benedict would not listen; he must return. His sister then buried
her face in her hands weeping and praying. Suddenly the sky was
overcast with clouds, and a terrific storm burst upon the
mountains, which prevented her brother's return. Three days later
Benedict saw the soul of his sister entering heaven. On March 21,
543, a short time after his sister's death, two monks beheld a
shining pathway of stars over which the soul of Benedict passed
from Monte Cassino to heaven. Such, in brief, is the story
preserved for us in his biography by the celebrated patron of
monasticism, Pope Gregory I.</p>
<br>

<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Rules_of_Benedict"></a>The Rules of
Benedict</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The rules, <i>regulae</i>, of St. Benedict, are worthy of
special consideration, since they constitute the real foundation of
his success and of his fame. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page139"></a>[pg 139]</span> His order was by far the most
important monastic brotherhood until the thirteenth century. Nearly
all the other orders which sprang up during this interval were
based upon Benedictine rules, and were really attempts to reform
the monastic system on the basis of Benedict's original practice.
Other monks lived austere lives and worked miracles, and some of
them formulated rules, but it is to Benedict and his rules that we
must look for the code of Western monachism. "By a strange
parallelism," says Putnam, "almost in the very year in which the
great Emperor Justinian was codifying the results of seven
centuries of Roman secular legislation for the benefit of the
judges and the statesmen of the new Europe, Benedict, on his lonely
mountain-top, was composing his code for the regulation of the
daily life of the great civilizers of Europe for seven centuries to
come."</p>
<p>The rules consist of a preface and seventy-three chapters. The
prologue defines the classes of monks, and explains the aim of the
"school of divine servitude," as Benedict described his monastery.
The following is a partial list of the subjects considered: The
character of an abbot, silence, maxims <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> for good works,
humility, directions as to divine service, rules for dormitories,
penalties, duties of various monastic officers, poverty, care of
the sick daily rations of food and drink, hours for meals, fasting,
entertainment of guests, and dress. They close with the statement
that the Benedictine rule is not offered as an ideal of perfection,
or even as equal to the teaching of Cassian or Basil, but for mere
beginners in the spiritual life, who may thence proceed
further.</p>
<p>The Benedictine novitiate extended over one year, but was
subsequently increased to three. At the close of this period the
novice was given the opportunity to go back into the world. If he
still persisted in his choice, he swore before the bones of the
saints to remain forever cut off from the rest of his fellow
beings. If a monk left the monastery, or was expelled, he could
return twice, but if, after the third admission, he severed his
connection, the door was shut forever.</p>
<p>The monk passed his time in manual labor, copying manuscripts,
reading, fasting and prayer. He was forbidden to receive letters,
tokens or gifts, even from his nearest-relatives, without
permission <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[pg
141]</span> from the abbot. His daily food allowance was usually a
pound of bread, a pint of wine, cider or ale, and sometimes fish,
eggs, fruit or cheese. He was dressed in a black cowl. His clothing
was to be suitable to the climate and to consist of two sets. He
was also furnished with a straw mattress, blanket, quilt, pillow,
knife, pen, needle, handkerchief and tablets. He was, in all
things, to submit patiently to his superior, to keep silence, and
to serve his turn in the kitchen. In the older days the monks
changed their clothes on the occasion of a bath, which used to be
taken four times a year. Later, bathing was allowed only twice a
year, and the monks changed their clothes when they wished.</p>
<p>Various punishments were employed to correct faults. Sometimes
the offender was whipped on the bare shoulders with a thick rod;
others had to lie prostrate in the doorway of the church at each
hour, so that the monks passed over his body on entering or going
out.</p>
<p>The monks formerly rose at two o'clock, and spent the day in
various occupations until eight at night, when they retired. The
following rules once governed St. Gregory's Monastery in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
England: "3:45 A.M. Rise. 4 A.M. Matins and lauds, recited;
half-hour mental prayer; prime <i>sung</i>; prime B.V.M. recited.
6:30 A.M. Private study; masses; breakfast for those who had
permission. 8 A.M. Lectures and disputations. 10 A.M. Little hours

Public spiritual reading; compline <i>sung</i>; matins and lauds
B.V.M., recited; half-hour mental prayer. 8:45 P.M. Retire[<a href=
"#NOTE_D">D</a>]."</p>
<p>Such a routine suggests a dreary life, but that would depend
upon the monk's temperament. Regularity of employment kept him
healthy, and if he did not take his sins too much to heart, he was
free from gloom. Hill very justly observes: "Whenever men obey that
injunction of labor, no matter what their station, there is in the
act the element of happiness, and whoever avoids that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> injunction, there
is always the shadow of the unfulfilled curse darkening their
path." Thus, their ideal was "to subdue one's self and then to
devote one's self," which De Tocqueville pronounces "the secret of
strength." How well they succeeded in realizing their ideal by the
methods employed we shall see later.</p>
<p>The term "order," as applied to the Benedictines, is used in a
different sense from that which it has when used of later monastic
bodies. Each Benedictine house was practically independent of every
other, while the houses of the Dominicans, Franciscans or Jesuits
were bound together under one head. The family idea was peculiar to
the Benedictines. The abbot was the father, and the monastery was
the home where the Benedictine was content to dwell all his life.
In the later monastic societies the monks were constantly traveling
from place to place. Taunton says: "As God made society to rest on
the basis of the family, so St. Benedict saw that the spiritual
family is the surest basis for the sanctification of the souls of
his monks. The monastery therefore is to him what the 'home' is to
lay-folk.... From this <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> family idea comes another result: the
very fact that St. Benedict did not found an Order but only gave a
Rule, cuts away all possibility of that narrowing <i>esprit de
corps</i> which comes so easily to a widespread and
highly-organized body."</p>
<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, however, it became
necessary for the general good of each family to secure some kind
of union. The Chapter then came into existence, which was a
representative body, composed of the heads of the different houses
and ordinary monks regularly appointed as delegates. To the Chapter
were committed various matters of jurisdiction, and also the power
of sending visitors to the different abbeys in the pope's name.</p>
<p>Each society was ruled by an abbot, who governed in Christ's
stead. Sometimes the members of the monastery were consulted, the
older ones ordinarily, the whole congregation; in important
matters. But implicit obedience to the abbot, as the representative
of God, was demanded by the vows.</p>
<p>The abbot was to be elected by the monks. At various periods
popes and princes usurped this power, but the monks always claimed
the right as an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[pg
145]</span> original privilege. Carlyle quotes Jocelin on Abbot
Samson, who says that the monks of St. Edmundsbury were compelled
to submit their choice to Henry II., who, looking at the committee
of monks somewhat sternly, said: "You present to me Samson; I do
not know him; had it been your prior, whom I do know, I should have
accepted him; however, I will now do as you wish. But have a care
of yourselves. By the true eyes of God, if you manage badly, I will
be upon you."</p>
<p>In Walter Scott's novel, "The Abbot," there is an interesting
contrast drawn between the ceremonies attending an abbot's
installation, when the monasteries were in their glory, and the
pitiable scenes in the days of their decline, when Mary Stuart was
a prisoner in Lochleven. In the monastery of Kennaquhair, which had
been despoiled by the fury of the times, a few monks were left to
mourn the mutilated statues and weep over the fragments of
richly-carved Gothic pillars. Having secretly elected an abbot,
they assembled in fear and trembling to invest him with the honors
of his office. "In former times," says Scott, "this was one of the
most splendid of the many pageants which the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span> hierarchy of Rome
had devised to attract the veneration of the faithful. When the
folding doors on such solemn occasions were thrown open, and the
new abbot appeared on the threshold in full-blown dignity, with
ring and mitre and dalmatique and crosier, his hoary
standard-bearers and juvenile dispensers of incense preceding him,
and the venerable train of monks behind him, his appearance was the
signal for the magnificent jubilate to rise from the organ and the
music-loft and to be joined by the corresponding bursts of
'Alleluiah' from the whole assembled congregation.</p>
<p>"Now all was changed. Father Ambrose stood on the broken steps
of the high altar, barefooted, as was the rule, and holding in his
hand his pastoral staff, for the gemmed ring and jewelled mitre had
become secular spoils. No obedient vassals came, man after man, to
make their homage and to offer the tribute which should provide
their spiritual superior with palfrey and trappings. No bishop
assisted at the solemnity to receive into the higher ranks of the
church nobility a dignitary whose voice in the legislature was as
potent as his own."</p>
<p>We are enabled by this partially-quoted description <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> to imagine the
importance attached to the election of an abbot. He became, in
feudal times, a lord of the land, the richest man in the community,
and a tremendous power in political councils and parliaments. A
Benedictine abbot once confessed: "My vow of poverty has given me a
hundred thousand crowns a year; my vow of obedience has raised me
to the rank of a sovereign prince."</p>
<p>No new principle seems to be disclosed by the Benedictine rules.
The command to labor had been emphasized even in the monasteries of
Egypt. The Basilian code contained a provision enforcing manual
labor, but the work was light and insufficient to keep the mind
from brooding. The monastery that was to succeed in the West must
provide for men who not only could toil hard, but who must do so if
they were to be kept pure and true; it must welcome men accustomed
to the dangerous adventures of pioneer life in the vast forests of
the North. The Benedictine system met these conditions by a unique
combination and application of well-known monastic principles; by a
judicious subordination of minor matters to essential discipline;
by bringing into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[pg
148]</span> greater prominence the doctrine of labor; by tempering
the austerities of the cell to meet the necessities of a severe
climate; and lastly, by devising a scheme of life equally adaptable
to the monk of sunny Italy and the rude Goth of the northern
forests.</p>
<p>It was the splendid fruition of many years of experiment amid
varying results. "It shows," says Schaff, "a true knowledge of
human nature, the practical wisdom of Rome and adaptation to
Western customs; it combines simplicity with completeness,
strictness with gentleness, humility with courage and gives the
whole cloister life a fixed unity and compact organization, which,
like the episcopate, possessed an unlimited versatility and power
of expansion."</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Struggle_against_Barbarism"></a>The Struggle
against Barbarism</i></h2>
<br>
<p>No institution has contributed as much to the amelioration of
human misery or struggled as patiently and persistently to
influence society for good as the Christian church. In spite of all
that may be said against the followers of the Cross, it still
remains true, that they have ever been foremost <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> in the
establishment of peace and justice among men.</p>
<p>The problem that confronted the church when Benedict began his
labors, was no less than that of reducing a demoralized and brutal
society to law and order. Chaos reigned, selfishness and lust ruled
the hearts of Rome's conquerors. The West was desolated by
barbarians; the East dismembered and worn out by theological
controversy. War had ruined the commerce of the cities and laid
waste the rural districts. Vast swamps and tracts of brush covered
fields once beautiful with the products of agricultural labor. The
minds of men were distracted by apprehensions of some frightful,
impending calamity. The cultured Roman, the untutored Goth and the
corrupted Christian were locked in the deadly embrace of despair.
"Constantly did society attempt to form itself," says Guizot,
"constantly was it destroyed by the act of man, by the absence of
the moral conditions under which alone it can exist."</p>
<p>But notwithstanding failures and discouragements, the work of
reconstructing society moved painfully on, and among the brave
master builders was Benedict of Nursia. "He found the world,
physical <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>[pg
150]</span> and social, in ruins," says Cardinal Newman, "and his
mission was to restore it in the way,--not of science, but of
nature; not as if setting about to do it; not professing to do it
by any set time, or by any series of strokes; but so quietly,
patiently, gradually, that often till the work was done, it was not
known to be doing. It was a restoration rather than a visitation,
correction or conversion. The new world he helped to create was a
growth rather than a structure."</p>
<p>But the chaos created by the irruption of the barbarous nations
at this period seriously affected the moral character and influence
of the clergy and the monks. The church seemed unequal to the
stupendous undertaking of converting the barbarians. The monks, as
a class, were lawless and vicious. Benedict himself testifies
against them, and declares that they were "always wandering and
never stable; that they obey their own appetites, whereunto they
are enslaved." Unable to control their own desires by any law
whatsoever, they were unfitted to the task before them. It was
imperative, then, that unity and order should be introduced among
the monasteries; that some sort of a uniform <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span> rule, adapted to
the existing conditions, should be adopted, not only for the
preservation of the monastic institution, but for the preparation
of the monks for their work. Therefore, although the Christianity
of that time was far from ideal, it was, nevertheless, a religion
within the grasp of the reckless barbarians; and subsequent events
prove that it possessed a moral power capable of humanizing
manners, elevating the intellect, and checking the violent temper
of the age.</p>
<p>Excepting always the religious services of the Benedictine
monks, their greatest contribution to civilization was literary and
educational[<a href="#NOTE_E">E</a>]. The rules of Benedict
provided for two hours a day of reading, and it was doubtless this
wise regulation that stimulated literary tastes, and resulted in
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
collecting of books and the reproduction of manuscripts. "Wherever
a Benedictine house arose, or a monastery of any one of the Orders,
which were but offshoots from the Benedictine tree, books were
multiplied and a library came into existence, small indeed at
first, but increasing year by year, till the wealthier houses had
gathered together collections of books that would do credit to a
modern university." There was great danger that the remains of
classic literature might be destroyed in the general devastation of
Italy. The monasteries rescued the literary fragments that escaped,
and preserved them. "For a period of more than six centuries the
safety of the literary heritage of Europe,--one may say of the
world,--depended upon the scribes of a few dozen scattered
monasteries."</p>
<p>The literary services of the earlier monks did not consist in
original production, but in the reproduction and preservation of
the classics. This work was first begun as a part of the prescribed
routine of European monastic life in the monastery at Vivaria, or
Viviers, France, which was founded by Cassiodorus about 539. The
rules of this cloister were based on those of Cassian, who died in
the early part of the fifth century. Benedict, at Monte Cassino,
followed the example of Cassiodorus, and the Benedictine Order
carried the work on for the seven succeeding centuries.</p>
<p>Cassiodorus was a statesman of no mean ability, and for over
forty years was active in the political <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span> circles of his
time, holding high official positions under five different Roman
rulers. He was also an exceptional scholar, devoting much of his
energy to the preservation of classic literature. His magnificent
collection of manuscripts, rescued from the ruins of Italian
libraries, "supplied material for the pens of thousands of monastic
scribes." If we leave out Jerome, it is to Cassiodorus that the
honor is due for joining learning and monasticism.</p>
<p>"Thus," remarks Schaff, "that very mode of life, which, in its
founder, Anthony, despised all learning, became in the course of
its development an asylum of culture in the rough and stormy times
of the migration and the crusades, and a conservator of the
literary treasures of antiquity for the use of modern times."</p>
<p>Cassiodorus, with a noble enthusiasm, inspired his monks to
their task. He even provided lamps of ingenious construction, that
seem to have been self-trimming, to aid them in their work. He
himself set an example of literary diligence, astonishing in one of
his age.</p>
<p>Putnam is justified in his praises of this remarkable character
when he declares: "It is not too <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> much to say that the continuity of
thought and civilization of the ancient world with that of the
middle ages was due, more than to any other one man, to the life
and labors of Cassiodorus."</p>
<p>But the monk was more than a scribe and a collector of books, he
became the chronicler and the school-teacher. "The records that
have come down to us of several centuries of medieval European
history are due almost exclusively to the labors of the monastic
chroniclers." A vast fund of information, the value of which is
impaired, it is true, by much useless stuff, concerning medieval
customs, laws and events, was collected by these unscientific
historians and is now accessible to the student.</p>
<p>At the end of the ninth century nearly all the monasteries of
Europe conducted schools open to the children of the neighborhood.
The character of the educational training of the times is not to be
judged by modern standards. A beginning had to be made, and that
too at a time "when neither local nor national governments had
assumed any responsibilities in connection with elementary
education, and when the municipalities were too ignorant, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> in many
cases too poor, to make provision for the education of the
children." It is therefore to the lasting credit of Benedict,
inspired no doubt by the example of Cassiodorus, that he commanded
his monks to read, encouraged literary work, and made provision for
the education of the young.</p>
<p>The Benedictines rendered a great social service in reclaiming
deserted regions and in clearing forests. "The monasteries," says
Maitland, "were, in those days of misrule and turbulence, beyond
all price, not only as places where (it may be imperfectly, but
better than elsewhere) God was worshipped,... but as central points
whence agriculture was to spread over bleak hills and barren downs
and marshy plains, and deal its bread to millions perishing with
hunger and its pestilential train." Roman taxation and barbarian
invasions had ruined the farmers, who left their lands and fled to
swell the numbers of the homeless. The monk repeopled these
abandoned but once fertile fields, and carried civilization still
deeper into the forests. Many a monastery with its surrounding
buildings became the nucleus of a modern city. The more awful the
darkness of the forest solitudes, the more the monks <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> loved it. They cut
down trees in the heart of the wilderness, and transformed a soil
bristling with woods and thickets into rich pastures and ploughed
fields. They stimulated the peasantry to labor, and taught them
many useful lessons in agriculture. Thus, they became an
industrial, as well as a spiritual, agency for good.</p>
<p>The habits of the monks brought them into close contact with
nature. Even the animals became their friends. Numerous stories
have been related of their wonderful power over wild beasts and
their conversations with the birds. "It is wonderful," says Bede,
"that he who faithfully and loyally obeys the Creator of the
universe, should, in his turn, see all the creatures obedient to
his orders and his wishes." They lived, so we are told, in the most
intimate relations with the animal creation. Squirrels leaped to
their hands or hid in the folds of their cowls. Stags came out of
the forests in Ireland and offered themselves to some monks who
were ploughing, to replace the oxen carried off by the hunters.
Wild animals stopped in their pursuit of game at the command of St.
Laumer. Birds ceased singing at the request of some monks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span> until
they had chanted their evening prayer, and at their word the
feathered songsters resumed their music. A swan was the daily
companion of St. Hugh of Lincoln, and manifested its miraculous
knowledge of his approaching death by the most profound melancholy.
While all the details of such stories are not to be accepted as
literally true, no doubt some of this poetry of monastic history
rests upon interesting and charming facts.</p>
<p>A fuller discussion of the permanent contributions which the
monk made to civilization is reserved for the last chapter. I have
somewhat anticipated a closer scrutiny of his achievements in order
to present a clearer view of his life and labors. His religious
duties were, perhaps, wearisome enough. We might tire of his
monotonous chanting and incessant vigils, but it is gratifying to
know that he also engaged in practical and useful employments. The
convent became the house of industry as well as the temple of
prayer. The forest glades echoed to the stroke of the axe as well
as to hymns of praise. Yes, as Carlyle writes of the twelfth
century, "these years were no chimerical vacuity and dreamland
peopled with mere vaporous phantasms, but a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span> green solid place,
that grew corn and several other things. The sun shone on it, the
vicissitudes of seasons and human fortunes. Cloth was woven and
worn; ditches were dug, furrowed fields ploughed and houses
built."</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Spread_of_the_Benedictine_Rule"></a>The Spread
of the Benedictine Rule</i></h2>
<br>
<p>It is generally held that Benedict had no presentiment of the
vast historical importance of his system; and that he aspired to
nothing beyond the salvation of his own soul and those of his
brethren.</p>
<p>But the rule spread with wonderful rapidity. In every rich
valley arose a Benedictine abbey. Britain, Germany, Scandinavia,
France and Spain adopted his rule. Princes, moved by various
motives, hastened to bestow grants of land on the indefatigable
missionary who, undeterred by the wildness of the forest and the
fierceness of the barbarian, settled in the remotest regions. In
the various societies of the Benedictines there have been
thirty-seven thousand monasteries and one hundred and fifty
thousand abbots. For the space of two <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> hundred and
thirty-nine years the Benedictines governed the church by
forty-eight popes chosen from their order. They boast of two
hundred cardinals, seven thousand archbishops, fifteen thousand
bishops and four thousand saints. The astonishing assertion is also
made that no less than twenty emperors and forty-seven kings
resigned their crowns to become Benedictine monks. Their convents
claim ten empresses and fifty queens. Many of these earthly rulers
retired to the seclusion of the monastery because their hopes had
been crushed by political defeat, or their consciences smitten by
reason of crime or other sins. Some were powerfully attracted by
the heroic element of monastic life, and these therefore spurned
the luxuries and emoluments of royalty, in order by personal
sacrifice to achieve spiritual domination in this life, and to
render their future salvation certain. But whatever the motive that
drew queens and princes to the monastic order, the retirement of
such large numbers of the nobility indicates the influence of a
religious system which could cope so successfully with the
attractions of the palace and the natural passion for political
dominion.</p>
<p>Saint Gregory the Great, the biographer of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> Benedict, who was
born at Rome in 540 A.D. and so was nearly contemporaneous with
Benedict was a zealous promoter of the monastic ideal, and did as
much as any one to advance its ecclesiastical position and
influence. He founded seven monasteries with his paternal
inheritance, and became the abbot of one of them. He often
expressed a desire to escape the clamor of the world by retirement
to a lonely cell. Inspired by the loftiest estimates of his holy
office, he sought to reform the church in its spirit and life. Many
of his innovations in the church service bordered upon a dangerous
and glittering pomp; but the musical world will always revere his
memory for the famous chants that bear his name.</p>
<p>Gregory surrounded himself with monks, and did everything in his
power to promote their interests. He increased the novitiate to two
years, and exempted certain monasteries from the control of the
bishops. Other popes added to these exemptions, and thus widened
the breach which already existed between the secular clergy and the
monks. He also fixed a penalty of lifelong imprisonment for
abandonment of the monastic life.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
<p>Under Gregory's direction many missionary enterprises were
carried on, notably that of Augustine to England. The story runs
that one day Gregory saw some men and beautiful children from
Britain put up for sale in the market-place. Deeply sighing, he
exclaimed: "Alas for grief! That the author of darkness possesses
men of so bright countenance, and that so great grace of aspect
bears a mind void of inward grace!" He then asked the children the
name of their nation. "Angles," was the reply. "It is well," he
said, "for they have <i>angelic</i> faces. What is the name of your
province?" It was answered, "Deira." "Truly," he said,
"<i>De-ira-ns,</i> drawn from anger, and called to the mercy of
Christ. How is your king called?" They answered, "&AElig;lla, or
Ella." Then he cried "<i>Alleluia!</i> it behooves that the praise
of God the Creator should be sung in those parts." While it is hard
to accept this evidently fanciful story in its details, it seems
quite probable that the sale of some English slaves in a Roman
market drew the attention of Gregory to the needs of Britain.</p>
<p>Some years afterwards, in 596, Gregory commissioned <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span> Augustine, prior of
the monastery of St. Andrew's on the Celian Hill, at Rome, with
forty companions, to preach the gospel in Britain. When this
celebrated missionary landed on the island of Thanet, he found
monasticism had preceded him. But what was the nature of this
British monasticism? On that question Rome and England are
divided.</p>
<p>The Romanist declares that no country received the Christian
faith more directly from the Church of Rome than did England; that
the most careful study of authentic records reveals no doctrinal
strife, no diversity of belief between the early British monks and
the Pope of Rome; that St. Patrick, of Ireland, and St. Columba, of
Scotland, were loyal sons of their Roman mother.</p>
<p>The Anglican, on the other hand, believes that Christianity was
introduced into Britain independently of Rome. As to the precise
means employed, he has his choice of ten legends. He may hold with
Lane that it is reasonable to suppose one of Paul's ardent
converts, burning with fervent zeal, led the Britons to the cross.
Or he may argue with others: "What is more natural than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> imagine
that Joseph of Arimathea, driven from Palestine, sailed away to
Britain." In proof of this assumption, we are shown the chapel of
St. Joseph, the remains of the oldest Christian church, where the
holy-thorn blossoms earlier than in any other part of England. Many
Anglicans wisely regard all this as legendary. It is also held that
St. Patrick and St. Columba were not Romanists, but represented a
type of British Christianity, which, although temporarily subjected
to Rome, yet finally threw off the yoke under Henry VIII. and
reasserted its ancient independence. Still others declare that when
Augustine was made archbishop, the seat of ecclesiastical authority
was transferred from Rome to Canterbury, and the English church
became an independent branch of the universal church. It was
Catholic, but not Roman.</p>
<p>The difficulty of ascertaining when and by whom Christianity was
originally introduced into southern Britain must be apparent to
every student. But some things may be regarded as historically
certain. The whole country had been desolated by war when Augustine
arrived. For a hundred and fifty years the brutality and ignorance
of the barbarians had <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> reigned supreme. All traces of Roman
civilization had nearly disappeared with the conquest of the
heathen Anglo-Saxons. Whatever may be thought about the subsequent
effects of the triumph of Roman Christianity, it is due to Rome to
recognize the fact that with the coming of the Roman missionaries
religion and knowledge began a new life.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons had destroyed the Christian churches and
monasteries, whose origin, as we have seen, is unknown. They drove
away or massacred the priests and monks. Christianity was
practically extirpated in those districts subject to the Germanic
yoke. But when Augustine landed British monks were still to be
found in various obscure parts of the country, principally in
Ireland and Wales. Judging from what is known of these monks, it is
safe to say that their habits and teachings were based on the
traditions of an earlier Christianity, and that originally British
Christianity was independent of Rome.</p>
<p>The monks in Britain at the time when Augustine landed differed
from the Roman monks in their tonsures, their liturgy, and the
observance of Easter, although no material difference in doctrine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span> can be
established. The clergy did not always observe the law of celibacy
nor perhaps the Roman rules of baptism. It is also admitted, even
by Catholic historians, that the British monks refused to
acknowledge Augustine their archbishop; that this question divided
the royal family; and that the old British church was not
completely subdued until Henry II. conquered Ireland and Wales.
These statements are practically supported by Ethelred L. Taunton,
an authoritative writer, whose sympathy with Roman monasticism is
very strong. He thinks that a few of the British monks submitted to
Augustine, but of the rest he says: "They would not heed the call
of Augustine, and on frivolous pretexts refused to acknowledge
him." A large body of British monks retired to the monastery of
Bangor, and when King Ethelfrid invaded the district of Wales, he
slew twelve hundred of them in the open field as they were upon
their knees praying for the success of the Britons. It was then
that the power of the last remnants of Celtic or British
Christianity was practically broken, and the Roman type henceforth
gradually acquired the mastery.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>[pg 166]</span>
<p>Montalembert says: "In no other country has Catholicism been
persecuted with more sanguinary zeal; and, at the same time, none
has greater need of her care." While the latter observation is open
to dispute, it is certainly true that England has never remained
quiet under the dominion of Rome. Goldsmith's tribute to the
English character suggests a reasonable explanation of this
historic fact:</p>
<blockquote>"Stern o'er each bosom reason holds her state,<br>
Fierce in their native hardiness of soul,<br>
True to imagined right, above control,<br>
While even the peasant boasts those rights to scan,<br>
And learns to venerate himself as man."</blockquote>
<p>The fact to be remembered, as we emerge from these
ecclesiastical quarrels and the confusions of this perplexing
history, is that the monks were the intellectual and religious
leaders of those days. They exercised a profound influence upon
English society, and had much to do with the establishment of
English institutions.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the continent is indebted to England for
the gift of many noble monks who served France and Germany as
intellectual and moral guides, at a time when these countries were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>[pg 167]</span> in a
state of extreme degradation. Boniface, the Apostle to the Germans,
who is regarded by Neander as the Father of the German church and
the real founder of the Christian civilization of Germany, was the
gift of the English cloisters, and a native of Devonshire. Alcuin,
the ecclesiastical prime minister of Charlemagne and the greatest
educator of his time, was born and trained in England. Nearly all
the leading schools of France were founded or improved by this
celebrated monk. It was largely due to Alcuin's unrivaled energy
and splendid talents that Charlemagne was able to make so many and
so glorious educational improvements in his empire.</p>
<p>Notable among the men who introduced the Benedictine rule into
England was St. Wilfred (634-709 A.D.), who had traveled
extensively in France and Italy, and on his return carried the
monastic rule into northern Britain. He also is credited with
establishing a course of musical training in the English
monasteries. He was the most active prelate of his age in the
founding of churches and monasteries, and in securing uniformity of
discipline and harmony with the Church of Rome.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>[pg 168]</span>
<p>One of the most famous monastic retreats of those days was the
wild and lonely isle of Iona, the Mecca of monks and the monastic
capital of Scotland. It is a small island, three miles long and one
broad, lying west of Scotland. Many kings of Scotland were crowned
here on a stone which now forms a part of the British coronation
chair. Its great monastery enjoyed the distinction from the sixth
to the eighth century of being second to none in its widespread
influence in behalf of the intellectual life of Europe.</p>
<p>This monastery was originally founded in the middle of the sixth
century by Columba, the Apostle to Caledonia, an Irish saint
actively associated with a wonderful intellectual awakening. The
rule of the monastery is unknown, but it is probable that it could
not have been, at the first, of the Benedictine type. Columba's
followers traveled as missionaries and teachers to all parts of
Europe, and it is said, they dared to sail in their small boats
even as far as Iceland.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnson says in his "Tour to the Hebrides": "We are now
treading that illustrious island which was once the luminary of the
Caledonian regions, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"></a>[pg
169]</span> whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived the
benefits of knowledge and the blessing of religion. That man is
little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the
plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the
ruins of Iona." The monastery which Columba founded here was
doubtless of the same character as the establishments in Ireland.
Many of these Celtic buildings were made of the branches of trees
and supported by wooden props. It was some time before
properly-constructed wooden churches or monasteries became general
in these wild regions. In such rude huts small libraries were
collected and the monks trained to preach. Ireland was then the
center of knowledge in the North. Greek, Latin, music and such
science as the monks possessed were taught to eager pupils. Copies
of their manuscripts are still to be found all over Europe. Their
schools were open to the rich and poor alike. The monks went from
house to house teaching and distributing literature. As late as the
sixteenth century, students from various parts of the Continent
were to be found in these Irish schools.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span>
<p>There is an interesting story related of Columba's literary
activities. It is said that on one occasion while visiting his
master, Finnian, he undertook to make a clandestine copy of the
abbot's Psalter. When the master learned of the fact, he
indignantly charged Columba with theft, and demanded the copy which
he had made, on the ground that a copy made without permission of
the author was the property of the original owner, because a
transcript is the offspring of the original work. Putnam, to whom I
am indebted for this story, says: "As far as I have been able to
ascertain, this is the first instance which occurs in the history
of European literature of a contention for a copyright." The
conflict for this copyright afterwards developed into a civil war.
The copy of the Latin Psalter "was enshrined in the base of a
portable altar as the national relic of the O'Donnell clan," and
was preserved by that family for thirteen hundred years. It was
placed on exhibition as late as 1867, in the museum of the Royal
Irish Academy.</p>
<p>Enough has now been said to enable the reader to understand
something of the spirit and labors of the monks in an age
characteristically <span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>[pg
171]</span> barbaric. For five centuries, from the fifth to the
tenth, the condition of Europe was deplorable. "It may be doubted,"
says an old writer, "whether the worst of the C&aelig;sars exceeded
in dark malignity, or in capriciousness of vengeance, the
long-haired kings of France." The moral sense of even the most
saintly churchmen seems to have been blunted by familiarity with
atrocities and crimes. Brute force was the common method of
exercising control and administering justice. The barbarians were
bold and independent, but cruel and superstitious. Their furious
natures needed taming and their rude minds tutoring. Even though
during this period churches and monasteries were raised in amazing
numbers, yet the spirit of barbarism was so strong that the
Christians could scarcely escape its influence. The power of
Christianity was modified by the nature of the people, whose
characters it aimed to transform. The remarks of William Newton
Clarke respecting the Christians of the first and second centuries
are also appropriate to the period under review: "The people were
changed by the new faith, but the new faith was changed by the
people." Christianity "made a new people, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> better than it
found them, but they in turn made a new Christianity, with its
strong points illustrated and confirmed in their experience, but
with weakness brought in from their defects."</p>
<p>Yes, the work of civilizing the Germanic nations was a task of
herculean proportions and of tremendous significance. Out of these
tribes were to be constructed the nations of modern Europe. To this
important mission the monks addressed themselves with such courage,
patience, faith and zeal, as to entitle them to the veneration of
posterity. With singular wisdom and unflinching bravery they
carried on their missionary and educational enterprises, in the
face of discouragements and obstacles sufficient to dismay the
bravest souls. The tenacious strength of those wild forces that
clashed with the tenderer influences of the cloister should soften
our criticism of the inconsistencies which detract from the glory
of those early ministers of righteousness and exemplars of
gentleness and peace.</p>

MILITARY ORDERS</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The monastic institution was never entirely good or entirely
bad. In periods of general degradation there were beautiful
exceptions in monasteries ruled by pure and powerful abbots. From
the beginning various monasteries soon departed from their
discipline by sheltering iniquity and laziness, while other
establishments faithfully observed the rules. But during the
eighth, ninth and tenth centuries there was a widespread decline in
the spirit of devotion and a shameful relaxation of monastic
discipline. Malmesbury, King Alfred, Alcuin, in England, and many
continental writers, sorrowfully testified against the monks
because of their vices, their revelings, their vain and gorgeous
ornaments of dress and their waning zeal for virtue. The priests
hunted and fought, prayed, preached, swore <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> and drank as they
pleased. "We cannot wonder," says an anonymous historian, "that
they should commit the more reasonable offence of taking wives."
Disorders were common everywhere; the monastic vows were sadly
neglected. Political and religious ideals were lost sight of amid
the prevailing confusion and wild commotion of those dark days. "It
is true," says Carlyle, "all things have two faces, a light one and
a dark. It is true in three centuries much imperfection
accumulates; many an ideal, monastic or otherwise, shooting forth
into practice as it can, grows to a strange reality; and we have to
ask with amazement, Is this your ideal? For alas the ideal has to
grow into the real, and to seek out its bed and board there, often
in a sorry way."</p>
<p>This, then, may be accepted as the usual history of a monastery
or a monastic order. First, vows of poverty, obedience and chastity
zealously cherished and observed; as a result of loyalty to this
ideal, a spirit of devotion to righteousness is created, and a
pure, lofty type of Christian life is formed, which, if not the
highest and truest, is sufficiently exalted to win the reverence of
worldly men and an extra-ordinary <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page175"></a>[pg 175]</span> power over their lives and
affections. There naturally follow numerous and valuable gifts of
land and gold. The monks become rich as well as powerful. Then the
decline begins. Vast riches have always been a menace to true
spirituality. Perhaps they always will be. The wealthy monk falls a
prey to pride and arrogance; he becomes luxurious in his habits,
and lazy in the performance of duty. Vice creeps in and his moral
ruin is complete. The transformation in the character of the monk
is accompanied by a change in public opinion. The monk is now an
eyesore; his splendid buildings are viewed with envy by some, with
shame by others. Then arise the vehement cries for the destruction
of his palatial cloister, and the heroic efforts of the remnant
that abide faithful to reform the institution. This has been the
pathway over which every monastic order has traveled. As long as
there was sufficient vitality to give birth to reformatory
movements, new societies sprang up as off-shoots of the older
orders, some of which adopted the original rules, while others
altered them to suit the views of the reforming founder. "For
indeed," says <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>[pg
176]</span> Trench, "those orders, wonderful at their beginning,
and girt up so as to take heaven by storm, seemed destined to
travel in a mournful circle from which there was no escape." These
facts partly explain the reformatory movements which appear from
the ninth century on.</p>
<p>The first great saint to enter the lists against monastic
corruption was Benedict of Aniane (750-821 A.D.), a member of a
distinguished family in southern France. The Benedictine rule in
his opinion was formed for novices and invalids. He attributed the
prevailing laxity among the monks to the mild discipline. As abbot
of a monastery he undertook to reform its affairs by adopting a
system based on Basil of Asia Minor and Pachomius of Egypt. But he
leaned too far back for human nature in the West, and the
conclusion was forced upon him that Benedict of Nursia had
formulated a set of rules as strict as could be enforced among the
Western monks. Accordingly he directed his efforts to secure a
faithful observance of the original Benedictine rules, adding,
however, a number of rigid and burdensome regulations. Although at
first the monks doubted his sanity, kicked him <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> and spat on him,
yet he afterwards succeeded in gathering about three hundred of
them under his rule. Several colonies were sent out from his
monastery, which was built on his patrimonial estate near
Montpellier. His last establishment, which was located near
Aix-la-Chapelle, became famous as a center of learning and
sanctity.</p>
<p>One of the most celebrated reform monasteries was the convent of
Cluny, or Clugny, in Burgundy, about fifteen miles from Lyons,
which was founded by Duke William of Aquitaine in 910. It was
governed by a code based on the rule of St. Benedict. The monastery
began with twelve monks under Bruno, but became so illustrious that
under Hugo there were ten thousand monks in the various convents
under its rule. It was made immediately subject to the pope,--that
is, exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop. Some idea of its
splendid equipment may be formed from the fact that it is said,
that in 1245, after the council of Lyons, it entertained Innocent
IV., two patriarchs, twelve cardinals, three archbishops, fifteen
bishops, many abbots, St. Louis, King of France, several princes
and princesses, each with a considerable <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span> retinue, yet the
monks were not incommoded. It gave to the church three
popes,--Gregory VII., Urban II. and Paschal II.</p>
<p>From his cell at Cluny, Hildebrand, who became the famous
Gregory VII., looked out upon a world distracted by war and sunk in
vice. "In Hildebrand's time, while he was studying those annals in
Cluny," says Thomas Starr King, "a boy pope, twelve years old, was
master of the spiritual scepter, and was beginning to lead a life
so shameful, foul and execrable that a subsequent pope said, 'he
shuddered to describe it.'"</p>
<p>Connected with the monastery was the largest church in the
world, surpassed only a little, in later years, by St. Peter's at
Rome. Its construction was begun in 1089 by the abbot Hugo, and it
was consecrated in 1131, under the administration of Peter the
Venerable. It boasted of twenty-five altars and many costly works
of art.</p>
<p>So great was the fame and influence of this establishment that
numerous convents in France and Italy placed themselves under its
control, thus forming "The Congregation of Cluny."</p>
<p>After the administration of Peter the Venerable <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span> (1122-1156), this
illustrious house began to succumb to the intoxication of success,
and it steadily declined in character and influence until its
property was confiscated by the Constituent Assembly, in 1799, and
the church sold for one hundred thousand francs. It is now in
ruin.</p>
<p>But in spite of every attempt at reform during the ninth and
tenth centuries the decline of the continental monasteries
continued. Many persons of royal blood, accustomed to the license
of palaces, entered the cloister and increased the disorders. The
monks naturally respected their blood and relaxed the discipline in
their favor. The result was costly robes, instead of the simple,
monastic garb, riotous living, and a general indifference to
spirituality. Spurious monasteries sprang up with rich lay-abbots
at their head, who made the office hereditary in their families.
Laymen were appointed to rich benefices simply that they might
enjoy the revenues. These lay-abbots even went so far as to live
with their families in their monasteries, and rollicking midnight
banquets were substituted for the asceticism demanded by the vows.
They traveled extensively attended by <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> splendid retinues.
Some of the monks seemed intent on nothing but obtaining charters
of privileges and exemptions from civil and military duties.</p>
<p>In England the state of affairs was even more distressing than
on the Continent. The evil effects of the Saxon invasion, the
demoralization that accompanied the influx of paganism, and the
almost complete destruction of the religious institutions of
British Christianity have already been noted. About the year 700,
the island was divided among fifteen petty chiefs, who waged war
against one another almost incessantly. Christianity, as introduced
by Augustine, had somewhat mitigated the ferocity of war, and
England had begun to make some approach toward a respect for law
and a veneration for the Christian religion, when the Danes came,
and with them another period of disgraceful atrocities and
blighting heathenism. The Danish invasion had almost extirpated the
monastic institution in the northern districts. Carnage and
devastation reigned everywhere. Celebrated monasteries fell in
ruins and the monks were slain or driven into exile. Hordes of
barbaric warriors roamed the country, burning and plundering.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>
<p>"At the close of this calamitous period," says Lingard, in his
"History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church," "the
Anglo-Saxon church presented a melancholy spectacle to the friends
of religion: 1. The laity had resumed the ferocious manners of
their pagan forefathers. 2. The clergy had grown indolent,
dissolute and illiterate. 3. The monastic order had been apparently
annihilated. It devolved on King Alfred, victorious over his
enemies, to devise and apply the remedies for these evils." The
good king endeavored to restore the monastic institution, but,
owing to the lack of candidates for the monastic habit, he was
compelled to import a colony of monks from Gaul.</p>
<p>The moral results of Alfred's reformatory measures, as well as
those of his immediate successors, were far from satisfactory,
although he did vastly stimulate the educational work of the
monastic schools. He devoted himself so faithfully to the gathering
of traditions, that he is said to be the father of English history.
The tide of immorality, however, was too strong to be stemmed in a
generation or two. It was a century and a half <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> before there was
even an approach to substantial victory over the disgraceful abuses
among the clergy and the monks.</p>
<p>The churchman who is credited with doing most to distinguish the
monks as a zealous and faithful body was Dunstan (924-988 A.D.),
first Abbot of Glastonbury, then Bishop of Winchester, and finally
Archbishop of Canterbury. He is the most conspicuous ecclesiastical
personage in the history of those dark days, but his character and
labors have given rise to bitter and extensive controversy.</p>
<p>It was Dunstan's chief aim to subjugate the Anglo-Saxon church
to the power of Rome, and to correct existing abuses by compelling
the clergy and the monks to obey the rule of celibacy. He was a
fervent believer in the efficacy of the Benedictine vows, and in
the value of clerical celibacy as a remedy for clerical
licentiousness. Naturally, Protestant writers, who hold that papal
supremacy never was a blessing in any country or in any age, and
who think that clerical celibacy has always been a fruitful source
of crime and sin, condemn the reforms of Dunstan in the most
unqualified terms. A statement of a few of the many and perplexing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span> facts
may assist us to form a fairly just judgment of the man and his
work.</p>
<p>The principle of sacerdotal celibacy appeared early in the
history of Christianity, and for many centuries it was the subject
of sharp contention. Roman Catholics themselves have been divided
upon it. In every Christian country, from the Apostolic period
onward, there were priests and teachers who opposed the imposition
of this rule upon the clergy, and, on the other hand, there were
those who practiced and advocated celibacy as the indispensable
guarantee of spiritual power and purity.</p>
<p>What the rule of celibacy was at this period, in England, seems
uncertain. Lingard maintains that marriage was always permitted to
the clergy in minor orders, who were employed in various
subordinate positions, but that those in higher orders, whose
office it was to minister at the altar and to offer the sacrifice,
were expressly bound to a life of the strictest continence. During
the invasion of the Danes, when confusion reigned, many priests in
the higher orders had not only forsaken their vows of chastity, but
had plunged into frightful immoralities; and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span> married clerks of
inferior orders were raised to the priesthood to fill the ranks
depleted by war. These promoted clerks were previously required to
separate from their wives, but apparently many of them did not do
so. Consequently, from several causes, the married priests became a
numerous body, and since the common opinion seems to have been that
a married priest was disgracing his office, this body was regarded
as a menace to the welfare of the church and the state.</p>
<p>Lea, in his elaborate "History of Sacerdotal Celibacy," holds
that the rule of celibacy was only binding on the regulars, or
monks, and that the secular priesthood was at liberty to marry. But
from several other passages in his work it seems that he also
recognizes the fact that, while marriage was common, it was in
defiance of an ancient canon. "It is evident," he says, "that the
memory of the ancient canons was not forgotten, and that their
observance was still urged by some ardent churchmen, but that the
customs of the period had rendered them virtually obsolete, and
that no sufficient means existed of enforcing obedience. If open
scandals and shameless bigamy <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> and concubinage could be restrained,
the ecclesiastical authorities were evidently content. Celibacy
could not be enjoined as a law, but was rendered attractive by
surrounding it with privileges and immunities denied to him who
yielded to the temptations of the flesh."</p>
<p>Throughout Western Christendom the law of celibacy was openly
and shamefully trampled upon, and every reformer seemed to think
that the very first step toward any improvement in clerical morals
was to be taken by enforcing this rule.</p>
<p>When Dunstan commenced his reforms, the clergy were guilty of
graver sins than that of living in marriage relations. Adultery,
bigamy, swearing, fighting and drinking were the order of the day.
The monasteries were occupied by secular priests with wives or
concubines. All the chroniclers of this period agree in charging
the monks and clergy with a variety of dissipations and
disorders.</p>
<p>It is quite clear, therefore, that in Dunstan's view he was
doing the only right thing in trying to correct the existing abuses
by compelling the priests to adopt that celibate life without which
it was popularly believed the highest holiness and the largest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span>
usefulness could not be attained. In the light of this purpose and
this common opinion of his time, Dunstan and his mission should be
judged.</p>
<p>Dunstan was aided in his work by King Edgar the Pacific, who, by
the way, was himself compelled to go without his crown seven years
for violating the chastity of a nun. Oswald, the Bishop of
Worcester, and Ethelwold, the Bishop of Winchester, were also
zealously engaged in the task of reform.</p>
<p>A law was enacted providing that priests, deacons and
sub-deacons should live chastely or resign. As a result of this
law, many priests were ejected from the monasteries and from their
official positions. Strict monks were put in their places. A strong
opposition party was created, and the ejected clergy aroused such
discontent that a civil war was barely averted. This state of
things continued until the Norman invasion, when the monks and
secular clergy joined forces in the common defence of their
property and ecclesiastical rights.</p>
<p>It would seem that many writers, misled by legends for which
Dunstan must not be held responsible, and blinded by religious
prejudice, have unjustly charged him with hypocrisy and even crime.
All his methods <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>[pg
187]</span> may not be defensible when estimated in the light of
modern knowledge, and even his ideal may be rejected when judged by
modern standards of Christian character, but he must be considered
with the moral and intellectual life of his times in full view. He
was a champion of the oppressed, a friend of the poor, an
unflinching foe of sinful men in the pulpit or on the throne. His
will was inflexible, his independence noble and his energy
untiring. In trying to bring the Anglo-Saxon church into conformity
to Rome he was actuated by a higher motive than the merely selfish
desire for ecclesiastical authority. He regarded this harmony as
the only remedy for the prevailing disorders. He believed, like
many other churchmen of unquestioned purity and honesty, that it
was necessary to compel temporal authorities to recognize the power
of the church in order to overcome that defiance of moral law which
was the chief characteristic of the kings and princes in that
turbulent period.</p>
<p>What the Anglo-Saxon church might have been if the rule of
celibacy had not been forced upon her, and if she had not submitted
to Roman authority in other matters, is a theme for speculation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span> only.
The fact is that Dunstan found a church corrupt to the core and
left it, as a result of his purifying efforts, with some semblance,
to say the least, of moral influence and spiritual purity. Some
other kind of ecclesiastical polity than that advocated by Dunstan
might have achieved the same results as his, but the simple fact is
that none did. In so far as Dunstan succeeded in his monastic
measures, he laid the foundations of an ecclesiastical power which
afterwards became a serious menace to the political freedom of the
Anglo-Saxon race. The battle begun by him raged fiercely between
the popes, efficiently supported by the monks, and the kings of
England, with varying fortunes, for many centuries. But perhaps,
under the plans of that benign Providence who presides over the
destiny of nations, it was essentially in the interests of
civilization, that the lawlessness of rulers and the vices of the
people should be restrained by that ecclesiastical power, which, in
after years, and at the proper time, should be forced to recede to
its legitimate sphere and functions.</p>
<p>Another celebrated reformatory movement was begun by St. Bruno,
who founded the Carthusian <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page189"></a>[pg 189]</span> Order about the year 1086. Ruskin
says: "In their strength, from the foundation of the order at the
close of the eleventh century to the beginning of the fourteenth,
they reared in their mountain fastnesses and sent out to minister
to the world a succession of men of immense mental grasp and
serenely authoritative innocence, among whom our own Hugh of
Lincoln, in his relations with Henry II. and Coeur de Lion, is to
my mind the most beautiful sacerdotal figure known to me in
history."</p>
<p>Bruno, with six companions, established the famous Grand
Chartreuse in a rocky wilderness, near Grenoble, in France,
separated from the rest of the world by a chain of wild mountains,
which are covered with ice and snow for two-thirds of the year.</p>
<p>Until the time of Guigo (1137), the Grand Chartreuse was
governed by unwritten rules. Thirteen monks only were permitted to
live together, and sixteen converts in the huts at the foot of the
hill. The policy of this monastery was at first opposed to all
connection with other monasteries. But applications for admission
were so numerous that colonies were sent out in various directions,
all <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span>
subject to the mother house. The Carthusians differed in many
respects from other orders. The rules of Dom Guigo indicate that
the chief aim was to preclude the monks from intercourse with the
world, and largely with each other, for each monk had separate
apartments, cooked his own food, and so rarely met with his
brethren, that he was practically a hermit. The clothing consisted
of a rough hair shirt, worn next the skin, a white cassock over it,
and, when they went out, a black robe. Fasting was observed at
least three days a week, and meat was strictly forbidden.
Respecting contact with women Dom Guigo says: "Under no
circumstances whatever do we allow women to set foot within our
precincts, knowing as we do that neither wise man, nor prophet, nor
judge, nor the entertainer of God, nor the sons of God, nor the
first created of mankind, fashioned by God's own hands, could
escape the wiles and deceits of women."</p>
<p>Blistering and bleeding, as well as fasting, were employed to
control evil impulses. On the whole, the austerities were as severe
as human nature in that wild and cold region could endure. Yet the
prosperity that rewarded the piety and labors of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> Carthusian monks
proved more than a match for their rigorous discipline, and in the
middle of the thirteenth century we read charges of laxity and
disorder.</p>
<p>The Carthusians settled in England in the twelfth century, and
had a famous monastery in London, since called the Charterhouse.
The order was in many respects the most successful attempt at
reform, but as has been said, "the whole order, and each individual
member, is like a petrifaction from the Middle Ages." Owing to its
extremely solitary ideal and its severe discipline, it was unfitted
to secure extensive control, or to gain a permanent influence upon
the rapidly-developing European nations. Its chief contributions to
modern civilization were made by the gift of noble men who passed
from the seclusion of the cell into the active life of the world,
thus practically proving that the monks' greatest usefulness was
attained when loyalty to their vows yielded to a broader ideal of
Christian character and service.</p>
<p>Thus the months passed into years and the years into centuries.
Man was slowly working out his salvation. Painfully, laboriously he
emerged out <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>[pg
192]</span> of barbarism into the lower forms of civilization;
wearily he trudged on his way toward the universal kingdom of
righteousness and peace.</p>
<p>There were many other attempts at reform which may not even be
mentioned, but one character deserves brief consideration,--Bernard
of Clairvaux,--the fairest flower of those corrupt days. The order
to which he belonged was the Cistercians, so named because their
mother house was at Citeaux (Latin, <i>Cistercium</i>), in France.
Its members are sometimes called the "White Monks," because of
their white tunics. Their buildings, with their bare walls and low
rafters, were a rebuke to the splendid edifices of the richer
orders. Austere simplicity characterized their churches, liturgy
and habits. Gorgeousness in decoration and ostentation in public
services were carefully avoided. They used no pictures, stained
glass or images. Once a week they flogged their sinful bodies. Only
four hours' sleep was allowed. Seeking out the wildest spots and
most rugged peaks they built their retreats, beautiful in their
simplicity and furnishing some of the finest examples of monastic
architecture. The order spread into England, where the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span>
Cistercians were characterized by devoutness and poverty. After a
while the hand of fate wrote of them as it had of so many, "none
were more greedy in adding farm to farm; none less scrupulous in
obtaining grants of land from wealthy patrons." In general, the
order was no better and no worse than the rest, but its chief glory
is derived from the luster that was shed upon it by Bernard.</p>

<b>Saint Bernard.</b></p>
<br>
<p>This illustrious counselor of kings and Catholic saint was born
in Burgundy in 1091. When about twenty years of age he entered the
monastery at Citeaux with five of his brothers. His genius might
have secured ecclesiastical preferment, but he chose to dig
ditches, plant fields and govern a monastery. He entered the
cloister at Citeaux because the monks were few and poor, and when
it became crowded because of his fame, and its rule became lax
because of the crowds, he left the cloister to found a home of his
own. The abbot selected twelve monks, following the number of
apostles, and at their head placed young Bernard. He led the twelve
to the valley of Wormwood, and there, in a cheerless forest, he
established the monastery of Clairvaux, or Clear Valley. His rule
was fiercely <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>[pg
194]</span> severe because he himself loved hardships and rough
fare. "It in no way befits religion," he writes, "to seek remedies
for the body, nor is it good for health either. You may now and
then take some cheap herb,--such as poor men may,--and this is done
sometimes. But to buy drugs, to hunt up doctors, to take doses, is
unbecoming to religion and hostile to purity." His success in
winning men to the monastic life was almost phenomenal. It was said
that "mothers hid their sons, wives their husbands, and companions
their friends, lest they be persuaded by his eloquent message to
enter the cloister." "He was avoided like a plague," says one.</p>
<p>Bernard's monks changed the whole face of the country by felling
trees and tilling the ground. Their spiritual power rid the valley
of Wormwood of its robbers, and the district grew rich and
prosperous. Thus Bernard became the most famous man of his time. He
was the arbiter in papal elections, the judge in temporal quarrels,
the healer of schisms and a powerful preacher of the crusades. He
was the embodiment of all that was best in the thought of his age.
His weaknesses and faults may largely be explained by the fact that
no man can rise <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>[pg
195]</span> entirely above the spirit of his times and absolutely
free himself from all pernicious tendencies. "As an advocate for
the rights of the church, for the immunities of the clergy, no less
than for the great interests of morality, he was fierce,
intractable, unforgiving, haughty and tyrannical." There was,
however, no note of insincerity in his work or writings, and no
tinge of hypocrisy in fervent zeal. He was brave, honest and pure;
controlled always by a consuming passion for the moral welfare of
the people.</p>
<p>Our chief interest in Bernard relates to his monastic work which
shed undying luster on his name. Vaughan, in his "Hours with the
Mystics," says of him: "His incessant cry for Europe is, Better
monasteries, and more of them. Let these ecclesiastical castles
multiply; let them cover and command the land, well garrisoned with
men of God, and then, despite all heresy and schism, theocracy will
flourish, the earth shall yield her increase, and all people praise
the Lord.... Bernard had the satisfaction of improving and
extending monasticism to the utmost; of sewing together, with
tolerable success, the rended vesture of the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span> papacy; of
suppressing a more popular and more scriptural Christianity for the
benefit of his despotic order; of quenching for a time, by the
extinction of Abelard, the spirit of free inquiry, and of seeing
his ascetic and superhuman ideal of religion everywhere accepted as
the genuine type of Christianity."</p>
<p>But in spite of Dunstans, Brunos and Bernards, the monastic
institution keeps on crumbling. The edifice will not stand much
more propping and tinkering. While we admire this display of moral
force, this commendable struggle of fresh courage and new hope
against disintegrating forces, the conviction gains ground that
something is radically wrong with the institution. There is
something in it which fosters greed and desperate ambition. "Is it
not a shame," we feel compelled to ask, "that so much splendid,
chivalrous courage and magnificent energy should be expended in
trying to prevent a structure from falling, which, it seems, could
not possibly have been saved?" But while the decay could not be
stayed, we must admire the noble aims and pious enthusiasm of the
reformers who sought to preserve an institution which to them
seemed the only hope of a sinful world.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
<p>Dr. Storrs, in his life of Bernard, says: "His soon-canonized
name has shone starlike in history ever since he was buried; and it
will not hereafter decline from its height or lose its luster,
while men continue to recognize with honor the temper of devoted
Christian consecration, a character compact of noble forces, and
infused with self-forgetful love for God and man."</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Military_Religious_Orders"></a>The Military
Religious Orders</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The life of Bernard forms an appropriate introduction to a
consideration of the Military Religious Orders. Although weary with
labor and the weight of years, he traveled over Europe preaching
the second crusade. "To kill or to be killed for Christ's sake is
alike righteous and alike safe," this was his message to the world.
In spite of the opposition of court advisers, Bernard induced Louis
VII. and Conrad of Germany to take the crusader's vow. He gave the
Knights Templars a new rule and kindled afresh a zeal for the
knighthood. Although the members of the Military Orders were not
monks in the strict sense of the word, yet they <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span> were soldier-monks,
and as such deserve to be mentioned here.</p>
<p>At the basis of all monastic orders, as has been pointed out,
were the three vows of obedience, celibacy and poverty. Certain
orders, by adding to these rules other obligations, or by laying
special stress on one of the three ancient vows, produced new and
distinct types of monastic character and life.</p>
<p>The Knights of the Hospital assumed as their peculiar work the
care of the sick. The Begging Friars, as will be seen later, were
distinguished by the importance which they attached to the rule of
poverty; the Jesuits, by exalting the law of unquestioning
obedience. In view of the warlike character of the Middle Ages it
is strange the soldier-monk did not appear earlier than he did. The
abbots, in many cases, were feudal lords with immense possessions
which needed protection like secular property, but as this could
not be secured by the arts of peace, we find traces of the union of
the soldier and the monk before the distinct orders professing that
character. The immediate cause of such organizations was the
crusades. There were numerous <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page199"></a>[pg 199]</span> societies of this character, some of
them so far removed from the monastic type as scarcely to be ranked
with monastic institutions. One list mentions two hundred and seven
of these Orders of Knighthood, comprising many varieties in theory
and practice. The most important were three,--the Knights of the
Hospital, or the Knights of St. John; the Knights Templars; and the
Teutonic Knights. The Hospitallers wore black mantles with white
crosses, the Templars white mantles with red crosses, and the
Teutonic Knights white mantles with black crosses. The mantles were
in fact the robe of the monk adorned with a cross. The whole system
was really a marriage of monasticism and chivalry, as Gibbon says:
"The firmest bulwark of Jerusalem was founded in the Knights of the
Hospital and of the Temple, that strange association of monastic
and military life. The flower of the nobility of Europe aspired to
wear the cross and profess the vows of these orders; their spirit
and discipline were immortal."</p>
<p>A passage in the Alexiad quoted in Walter Scott's "Robert of
Paris" reads: "As for the multitude of those who advanced toward
the great city let it <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> be enough to say, that they were as
the stars in the heaven or as the sand of the seashore. They were
in the words of Homer, as many as the leaves and flowers of
spring." This figurative description is almost literally true.
Europe poured her men and her wealth into the East. No one but an
eye-witness can conceive of the vast amount of suffering endured by
those fanatical multitudes as they roamed the streets of Jerusalem
looking for shelter, or lay starving by the roadside on a bed of
grass.</p>
<p>The term Hospitallers was applied to certain brotherhoods of
monks and laymen. While professing some monastic rule, the members
of these societies devoted themselves solely to caring for the sick
and the poor, the hospitals in those days being connected with the
monasteries.</p>
<p>About the year 1050 some Italian merchants secured permission to
build a convent in Jerusalem to shelter Latin pilgrims. The hotels
which sprang up after this were gradually transformed into
hospitals for the care of the sick and presided over by Benedictine
monks. The sick were carefully nursed and shelter granted to as
many as could be accommodated. Nobles abandoned the profession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span> arms
and, becoming monks, devoted themselves to caring for the
unfortunate crusaders in these inns. The work rapidly increased in
extent and importance. In the year 1099, Godfrey de Bouillon
endowed the original hospital, which had been dedicated to St.
John. He also established many other monasteries on this holy soil.
The monks, most of whom were also knights, formed an organization
which received confirmation from Rome, as "The Knights of St. John
of Jerusalem." The order rapidly assumed a distinctly military
character, for, to do its work completely, it must not only care
for the sick in Jerusalem, but defend the pilgrim on his way to the
Holy City. This ended in an undertaking to defend Christendom
against Mohammedan invasion and in fighting for the recovery of the
Holy Sepulcher.</p>
<p>After visiting some of these Palestinian monasteries, a king of
Hungary thus describes his impressions: "Lodging in their houses, I
have seen them feed every day innumerable multitudes of poor, the
sick laid on good beds and treated with great care. In a word, the
Knights of St. John are employed sometimes like Martha, in action,
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span>
sometimes like Mary, in contemplation, and this noble militia
consecrate their days either in their infirmaries or else in
engagements against the enemies of the cross."</p>
<p>The Knights Templars were far more militant than the Knights of
St. John, but they also were actuated by the monastic spirit.
Bernard tried to inspire this order with a strong Christian zeal so
that, as he said, "War should become something of which God could
approve." The success which attended its operations led as usual to
its corruption and decline. Beginning with a few crusaders leagued
together for service and living on the site of the ancient Temple
at Jerusalem, it soon widened the scope of its services and became
a powerful branch of the crusading army. It was charged by Philip
IV. of France, in 1307, with the most fearful crimes, to sustain or
to deny which accusations many volumes have been composed. Five
years later the order was suppressed and its vast accumulations
transferred to the Knights of St. John. "The horrible fate of the
Templars," says Allen, "was taken by many as a beginning and omen
of the destruction that would soon pass upon <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> all the hated
religious orders. And so this final burst of enthusiasm and
splendor in the religious life was among the prognostics of a state
of things in which monasticism must fade quite away."</p>
<p>Wondrous changes have taken place in those dark and troubled
years since Benedict began his labors at Monte Cassino, in 529. The
monk has prayed alone in the mountains, and converted the barbarian
in the forest. He has preached the crusades in magnificent
cathedrals, and crossed stormy seas in his frail bark. He has made
the schools famous by his literary achievements, and taught
children the alphabet in the woodland cell. He has been good and
bad, proud and humble, rich and poor, arrogant and gentle. He has
met the shock of lances on his prancing steed, and trudged barefoot
from town to town. He has copied manuscripts in the lonely Scottish
isle, and bathed the fevered brow of the pilgrim in the hospital at
Jerusalem. He has dug ditches, and governed the world as the pope
of the Church. He has held the plow in the furrow, and thwarted the
devices of the king. He has befriended the poor, and imposed
penance upon princes. He has imitated the poverty and purity of
Jesus, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>[pg
204]</span> aped the pomp and vice of kings. He has dwelt solitary
on cold mountains, subsisting on bread, roots and water, and he has
surrounded himself with menials ready to gratify every luxurious
wish, amid the splendor of palatial cloisters. Still there are new
types and phases of monasticism yet to appear. The monk has other
tasks to undertake, for the world is not yet sufficiently wearied
of his presence to destroy his cloister and banish him from the
land.</p>

<br>
<p>Abraham Lincoln only applied a general principle to a specific
case when he said, "This nation cannot long endure half slave and
half free." Glaring inconsistencies between faith and practice will
eventually destroy any institution, however lofty its ideal or
noble its foundation. God suffers long and is kind, but His
forbearance is not limitless. Monasticism, as has been shown, was
never free from serious inconsistency, from moral dualism. But the
power of reform prolonged its existence. It was constantly
producing fresh models of its ancient ideals. It had a hidden
reserve-force from which it supplied shining examples of a living
faith and a self-denying love, just at the time when it seemed as
if the system was about to perish forever. When these fresh
exhibitions of monastic fidelity likewise <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> became tarnished,
when men had tired of them and predicted the speedy collapse of the
institution, forth from the cloister came another body of monkish
recruits, to convince the world that monasticism was not dead; that
it did not intend to die; that it was mightier than all its
enemies. The day came, however, when the world lost its confidence
in an institution which required such constant reforming to keep it
pure, which demanded so much cleansing to keep it clean. Ideals
that could so quickly lose their influence for good came to be
looked upon with suspicion.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the thirteenth century we are confronted by
the anomaly of a church grossly corrupt but widely obeyed. She is
nearing the pinnacle of her power and the zenith of her glory,
although the parochial clergy have sunk into vice and incapacity,
and the monks, as a class, are lazy, ignorant and notoriously
corrupt. Two things, especially, command the attention,--first, the
immorality and laxity of the monks; and second, the growth of
heresies and the tendency toward open schism. The necessity of
reform was clearly apprehended by the church as well as by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span>
heretical parties, but, since the church had such a hold upon
society, those who sought to reform the monasteries by returning to
old beliefs and ancient customs were much more in favor than those
who left the church and opposed her from the outside. The
impossibility of substantial, internal reform had not yet come to
be generally recognized. As time passed the conviction that it was
of no use to attempt reforms from the inside gained ground; then
the separatists multiplied, and the shedding of blood commenced.
The world had to learn anew that it was futile to put new wine into
old bottles or to patch new cloth on an old garment.</p>
<p>"It is the privilege of genius," says Trench, "to evoke a new
creation, where to common eyes all appears barren and worn out."
Francis and Dominic evoked this new creation; but although the monk
now will appear in a new garb, he will prove himself to be about
the same old character whom the world has known a great many years;
when this discovery is made monasticism is doomed. Perplexed Europe
will anxiously seek some means of destruction, but God will have
Luther ready to aid in the solution of the problem.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Francis_Bernardone"></a>Francis Bernardone</i>,
1182-1226 <i>A.D.</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p>Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan Order, was born at
Assisi, a walled town of Umbria, in Italy. His father, Peter
Bernardone, or Bernardo, was in France on business when his son was
born and named. On his return, or, as some say, at a later time, he
changed his son's name from John to Francis. His wealth enabled him
to supply Francis with the funds necessary to maintain his
leadership among gay companions. Catholic writers are fond of
describing the early years of their saints as marked by vice in
order to portray them as miracles of grace. It is therefore
uncertain whether Francis was anything worse than a happy, joyous
lad, who loved fine clothes, midnight songs and parties of
pleasure. He was certainly a very popular and courteous lad, very
much in love with the world. During a short service in the army he
was taken prisoner. After his release he fell sick, and experienced
a temporary disgust with his past life. With his renewed health his
love of festivities and dress returned.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>
<p>Walking out one day, dressed in a handsome new suit, he met a
poor and ill-clad soldier; moved to pity, he exchanged his fine
clothes for the rags of the stranger. That night Francis dreamed of
a splendid castle, with gorgeous banners flying from its ramparts,
and suits of armor adorned with the cross. "These," said a voice,
"are for you and for your soldiers." We are told that this was
intended to be taken spiritually and was prophetic of the Begging
Friars, but Francis misunderstood the dream, taking it as a token
of military achievements. The next day he set off mounted on a fine
horse, saying as he left, "I shall be a great prince." But his weak
frame could not endure such rough usage and he was taken sick at
Spoleto. Again he dreamed. This time the vision revealed his
misinterpretation of the former message, and so, on his recovery,
he returned somewhat crestfallen to Assisi, where he gave his
friends a farewell feast. Thus at the threshold of his career we
note two important facts,--disease and dreams. All through his life
he had these fits of sickness, attended by dreams; and throughout
his life he was guided by these visions. Neander remarks: "It would
be a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>[pg 210]</span>
matter of some importance if we could be more exactly informed with
regard to the nature of his disease and the way in which it
affected his physical and mental constitution. Perhaps it might
assist us to a more satisfactory explanation of the eccentric vein
in his life, that singular mixture of religious enthusiasm
bordering insanity; but we are left wholly in the dark."</p>
<p>Francis now devoted himself to his father's business, but dreams
and visions continued to distress him. His spiritual fervor
increased daily. He grieved for the poor and gave himself to the
care of the sick, especially the lepers. During a visit to Rome he
became so sad at the sight of desperate poverty that he impetuously
flung his bag of gold upon the altar with such force as to startle
the worshipers. He went out from the church, exchanged his clothes
for a beggar's rags, and stood for hours asking alms among a crowd
of filthy beggars.</p>
<p>But though Francis longed to associate himself in some way with
the lowest classes, he could obtain no certain light upon his duty.
While prostrated before the crucifix, in the dilapidated church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span> St.
Damian, in Assisi, he heard a voice saying, "Francis, seest thou
not that my house is in ruins? Go and restore it for me." Again it
is said that this pointed to his great life-work of restoring
spiritual power to the church, but he again accepted the message in
a literal sense. Delighted to receive a command so specific, the
kneeling Francis fervently responded, "With good will, Lord," and
gladly entered upon the task of repairing the church of St. Damian.
"Having fortified himself by the sign of the cross," he took a
horse and a valuable bundle of goods belonging to his father and
sold both at Falingo. Instead of turning the proceeds over to his
father, Francis offered them to the priest of St. Damian, who,
fearing the father's displeasure, refused to accept the stolen
funds. The young zealot, "who had utter contempt for money," threw
the gold on one of the windows of the church. Such is the story as
gleaned from Catholic sources. The heretics, who have criticised
Francis for this conduct, are answered by the following ingenious
but dangerous sophistry: "It is certainly quite contrary to the
ordinary law of justice for one man to take for himself the
property of another; but if <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page212"></a>[pg 212]</span> Almighty God, to whom all things
belong, and for whom we are only stewards, is pleased to dispense
with this His own law in a particular case, and to bestow what He
has hitherto given to one upon another, He confers at the same time
a valid title to the gift, and it is no robbery in him who has
received it to act upon that title."</p>
<p>Fearing his father's wrath, Francis hid himself in the priest's
room, and contemporary authors assure us that when the irate parent
entered, Francis was miraculously let into the wall. Wading (1731
A.D.) says the hollow place may still be seen in the wall.</p>
<p>After a month, the young hero, confident of his courage to face
his father, came forth pale and weak, only to be stoned as a madman
by the people. His father locked him up in the house, but the
tenderer compassion of his mother released him from his bonds, and
he found refuge with the priest. When his father demanded his
return, Francis tore off his clothes and, as he flung the last rag
at the feet of his astounded parent, he exclaimed: "Peter
Bernardone was my father; I have but one father, He that is in
Heaven." The crowd was deeply <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page213"></a>[pg 213]</span> moved, especially when they saw
before them the hair shirt which Francis had secretly worn under
his garments. Gathering up all that was left to him of his son, the
father sadly departed, leaving the young enthusiast to fight his
own way through the world. Many times after that, the parents, who
tenderly watched over the lad in sickness and prayed for his
recovery, saw their beloved son leading his barefooted beggars
through the streets of his native town. But he will never more sing
his gay songs underneath their roof or sally forth with his merry
companions in search of pleasure. Francis was given a laborer's
cloak, upon which he made the sign of a cross with some mortar,
"thus manifesting what he wished to be, a half-naked poor one, and
a crucified man." Such was the saint, in 1206, in his twenty-fifth
year.</p>
<p>Francis now went forth, singing sacred songs, begging his food,
and helping the sick and the poor. He was employed "in the vilest
affairs of the scullery" in a neighboring monastery. At this time
he clothed himself in the monk's dress, a short tunic, a leathern
girdle, shoes and a staff. He waited upon lepers and kissed their
disgusting <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>[pg
214]</span> ulcers. Yet more, he instantly cured a dreadfully
cancerous face by kissing it. He ate the most revolting messes,
reproaching himself for recoiling in nausea. Thus the pauper of
Jesus Christ conquered his pride and luxurious tastes.</p>
<p>Francis finally returned to repair the church of St. Damian. The
people derided, even stoned him, but he had learned to rejoice in
abuse. They did not know of what stern stuff their fellow-townsman
was made. He bore all their insults meekly, and persevered in his
work, carrying stones with his own hands and promising the blessing
of God on all who helped him in his joyful task. His kindness and
smiles melted hatred; derision turned to admiration. "Many were
moved to tears," says his biographers, "while Francis worked on
with cheerful simplicity, begging his materials, stone by stone,
and singing psalms about the streets."</p>
<p>Two years after his conversion, or in 1208, while kneeling in
the church of Sta. Maria dei Angeli, he heard the words of Christ:
"Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses, neither
two coats nor shoes nor staff, but go and preach." Afterwards, when
the meaning of these words was <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> explained to him, he exclaimed: "This
is what I seek for!" He threw away his wallet, took off his shoes,
and replaced his leather girdle by a cord. His hermit's tunic
appearing too delicate, he put on a coarse, gray robe, reaching to
his feet, with sleeves that came down over his fingers; to this he
added a hood, covering his head and face. Clothing of this
character he wore to the end of his life. This was in 1208, which
is regarded as the first year of the Order of St. Francis. The next
year Francis gave this habit to those who had joined him.</p>
<p>So the first and chief of Franciscan friars, unattended by
mortal companions, went humbly forth to proclaim the grandeur and
goodness of a God, who, according to monastic teaching, demands
penance and poverty of his creatures as the price of his highest
favor and richest blessings. Nearly seven hundred long years have
passed since that eventful day, but the begging Brothers of Francis
still traverse those Italian highways over which the saint now
journeyed with meek and joyous spirit.</p>
<blockquote>"He was not yet far distant from his rising<br>
Before he had begun to make the earth<br>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span> For he

<p>In 1210, with eleven companions, his entire band, Francis went
to Rome to secure papal sanction. Pope Innocent III. was walking in
a garden of the Lateran Palace when a beggar, dusty and pale,
confronted him. Provoked at being disturbed in his thoughts, he
drove him away. That night it was the pope's turn to dream. He saw
a falling church supported by a poor and miserable man. Of course,
that man was Francis. Four or five years later the pope will dream
the same thing again. Then the poor man will be Dominic. In the
morning he sent for the monk whom he had driven from him as a
madman the day before. Standing before his holiness and the college
of cardinals, Francis pleaded his cause in a touching and eloquent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>
parable. His quiet, earnest manner and clear blue eyes impressed
every one. The pope did not give him formal sanction however--this
was left for Honorius III., November 29, 1223--but he verbally
permitted him to establish his order and to continue his
preaching.</p>
<p>Several times Francis set out to preach to the Mohammedans, but
failed to reach his destination. He finally visited Egypt during
the siege of Damietta, and at the risk of his life he went forth to
preach to the sultan encamped on the Nile. He is described by an
eye-witness "as an ignorant and simple man, beloved of God and
men." His courage and personal magnetism won the Mohammedan's
sympathy but not his soul. Although Francis courted martyrdom, and
offered to walk through fire to prove the truth of his message, the
Oriental took it all too good-naturedly to put him to the test, and
dismissed him with kindness.</p>
<p>Francis was a great lover of birds. The swallows he called his
sisters. A bird in the cage excited his deepest sympathy. It is
said he sometimes preached to the feathered songsters. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span> Longfellow has cast
one of these homilies into poetic form:</p>
<blockquote>"O brother birds, St. Francis said,<br>
Ye come to me and ask for bread,<br>
But not with bread alone to-day<br>
Shall ye be fed and sent away.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
Oh, doubly are ye bound to praise<br>
The great Creator in your lays;<br>
He giveth you your plumes of down,<br>
Your crimson hoods, your cloaks of brown.<br>
<br>
He giveth you your wings to fly<br>
And breathe a purer air on high,<br>
And careth for you everywhere,<br>
Who for yourselves so little care."</blockquote>
<p>Like all ascetics, Francis was tempted in visions. One cold
night he fancied he was in a home of his own, with his wife and
children around him. Rushing out of his cell he heaped up seven
hills of snow to represent a wife, four sons and daughters, and two
servants. "Make haste," he cried, "provide clothing for them lest
they perish with the cold," and falling upon the imaginary group,
he dispelled the vision of domestic bliss in the cold embrace of
the winter's snow. Mrs. Oliphant points out the fact that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span> unlike
most of the hermits and monks, Francis dreams not of dancing girls,
but of the pure love of a wife and the modest joys of a home and
children. She beautifully says: "Had he, for one sweet, miserable
moment, gone back to some old imagination and seen the unborn faces
shine beside the never-lighted fire? But Francis does not say a
word of any such trial going on in his heart. He dissipates the
dream by the chill touch of the snow, by still nature hushing the
fiery thoughts, by sudden action, so violent as to stir the blood
in his veins; and then the curtain of prayer and silence falls over
him, and the convent walls close black around."</p>
<p>The experience of the saint on Mount Alverno deserves special
consideration, not merely on account of its singularity, but also
because it affords a striking illustration of the difficulties one
encounters in trying to get at the truth in monastic narratives.
Francis had retired to Mount Alverno, a wild and rugged solitude,
to meditate upon the Lord's passion. For days he had been almost
distracted with grief and holy sympathy. Suddenly a seraph with six
wings stood before <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>[pg
220]</span> him. When the heavenly being departed, the marks of the
Crucified One appeared upon the saint's body. St. Bonaventure says:
"His feet and hands were seen to be perforated by nails in their
middle; the heads of the nails, round and black, were on the inside
of the hands, and on the upper parts of the feet; the points, which
were rather long, and which came out on the opposite sides, were
turned and raised above the flesh, from which they came out." There
also appeared on his right side a red wound, which often oozed a
sacred blood that stained his tunic.</p>
<p>This remarkable story has provoked considerable discussion.
One's conclusions respecting its credibility will quite likely be
determined by his general view of numerous similar narratives, and
by the degree of his confidence in the value of human testimony
touching such matters. The incongruities and palpable impostures
that seriously impair the general reliability of monkish historians
render it difficult to distinguish between the truths and errors in
their writings.</p>
<p>Some authorities hold that the marks did not appear on St.
Francis, and that the story is without <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span> foundation. But
Roman writers bring forward the three early biographers of Francis
who claim that the marks did appear. Pope Alexander IV. publicly
averred that he saw the wounds, and pronounced it heresy to doubt
the report. Popes Benedict XI., Sixtus IV., and Sixtus V.
consecrated and canonized the impressions by instituting a
particular festival in their honor. Numerous persons are said to
have seen the marks and to have kissed the nails, after the death
of the saint. Singularly enough, the Dominicans were inclined to
regard the story as a piece of imposture designed to exalt Francis
above Dominic.</p>
<p>But, if it be admitted that the marks did appear, as it is not
improbable, how shall the phenomenon be explained? At least four
theories are held: 1. Fraud; 2. The irresponsible self-infliction
of the wounds; 3. Physical effects due to mental suggestion or some
other psychic cause; 4. Miracle.</p>
<p>1. The temptation is strong to claim a fraud, especially because
the same witnesses who testify to the truth of the tale, also
relate such monstrous, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page222"></a>[pg 222]</span> incredible stories, that one is
almost forced to doubt either their integrity or their sanity. But
there is no evidence in support of so serious an indictment. After
showing that signs and portents attend every crisis in history,
Mrs. Oliphant says: "Every great spiritual awakening has been
accompanied by phenomena quite incomprehensible, which none but the
vulgar mind can attribute to trickery and imposture;" but still she
herself remains in doubt about the whole story.</p>
<p>2. Although Mosheim uses the term "fraud," it would seem that he
means rather the irresponsible self-infliction of the wounds. He
says: "As he [Francis] was a most superstitious and fanatical
mortal, it is undoubtedly evident that he imprinted on himself the
holy wounds. Paul's words, 'I bear in my body the marks of the Lord
Jesus,' may have suggested the idea of the fraud." The notion
certainly prevailed that Francis was a sort of second Christ, and a
book was circulated showing how he might be compared to Christ in
forty particulars. There are many things in his biography which, if
true, indicate that Francis yearned to imitate literally the
experiences of his Lord.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>
<p>3. Numerous experiments, conducted by scientific men, have
established the fact that red marks, swellings, blisters, bleeding
and wounds have been produced by mental suggestion.
Bj&ouml;rnstrom, in his work on "Hypnotism," after recounting
various experiments showing the effect of the imagination on the
body, says, respecting the <i>stigmata</i> of the Middle Ages:
"Such marks can be produced by hypnotism without deceit and without
the miracles of the higher powers." Prof. Fisher declares: "There
is no room for the suspicion of deceit. The idea of a strange
physical effect of an abnormal state is more plausible." Trench
thinks this is a reasonable view in the case of a man like Francis,
"with a temperament so irrepressible, of an organization so
delicate, permeated through and through with the anguish of the
Lord's sufferings, passionately and continually dwelling on the one
circumstance of his crucifixion." But others, despairing of any
rational solution, cut the Gordian knot and declare that "the
kindest thing to think about Francis is that he was crazy."</p>
<p>4. Roman Catholics naturally reject all explanations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span> that
exclude the supernatural, for, as Father Candide Chalippe affirms:
"Catholics ought to be cautious in adopting anything coming from
heretics; their opinions are almost always contagious." He
therefore holds fast to the miracles in the lives of the saints,
not only because he accepts the evidence, but because he believes
these wonderful stories "add great resplendency to the merits of
the saints, and, consequently, give great weight to the example
they afford us."</p>
<p>It is altogether probable that each one will continue to view
the whole affair as his predispositions and religious convictions
direct; some unconvinced by traditionary evidence and undismayed by
charges of heresy; others devoutly accepting every monkish miracle
and marveling at the obstinacy of unbelief.</p>
<p>Two years after the event just described Francis was carried on
a cot outside the walls of Assisi, where, lifting his hands he
blessed his native city. Some few days later, on October 4, 1226,
he passed away, exclaiming, "Welcome, Sister Death!"</p>
<p>Whatever we may think of the legends that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span> cluster about his
life, Francis himself must not be held responsible for all that has
been written about him. He himself was no phantom or mythical
being, but a real, earnest man who, according to his light, tried
to serve his generation. As he himself said: "A man is just so much
and no more as he is in the sight of God." "Francis appears to me,"
says Forsyth, "a genuine, original hero, independent, magnanimous,
incorruptible. His powers seemed designed to regenerate society;
but taking a wrong direction, they sank men into beggars." Through
the mist of tradition the holy beggar and saintly hero shines forth
as a loving, gentle soul, unkind to none but himself. However his
biography may be regarded, his life illustrates the beauty and
power of voluntary renunciation,--the fountain not only of religion
but of all true nobility of character. He may have been ignorant,
perhaps grossly so, as Mosheim thinks, but nevertheless he merits
our highest praise for striving honestly to keep his vow of poverty
in the days when worldly monks disgraced their sacred profession by
greed, ambition, and lustful indulgence.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Franciscan_Orders"></a>The Franciscan
Orders</i></h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>The orders which Francis founded were of three classes:</p>
<p>1. Franciscan Friars or Order of Friars Minor, called also Gray
or Begging Friars. The year in which Francis took the habit, 1208,
is reckoned the first year of the order, but the Rule was not given
until 1210.</p>
<p>This Rule, which has not been preserved, was very simple, and
doubtless consisted of a group of gospel passages, bearing on the
vow of poverty, together with a few precepts about the occupations
of the brethren. The pope was not asked to sanction the Rule but
only to give his approbation to the missions of the little band.
Some of the cardinals expressed their doubts about the mode of life
provided for in the rules. "But," replied Giovanni di San Paolo,
"if we hold that to observe gospel perfection and make profession
of it is an irrational and impossible innovation, are we not
convicted of blasphemy against Christ, the Author of the
Gospel?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>
<p>There was also the Rule of 1221, which makes an intermediate
stage between the first Rule and that which was approved by the
pope November 29, 1223. The Rule of 1210 was thoroughly Franciscan.
It was the expression of the passionate, fervent soul of Francis.
It was the cry of the human heart for God and purity. The Rule of
1223 shows that the church had begun to direct the movement.
Sabatier says of these two rules: "At the bottom of it all is the
antinome of law and love. Under the reign of law we are the
mercenaries of God, bound down to an irksome task, but paid a
hundred-fold, and with an indisputable right to our wages." Such
was the conception underlying the Rule of 1223. That of 1210 is
thus described: "Under the rule of love we are the sons of God, and
co-workers with Him; we give ourselves to Him without bargaining
and without expectation; we follow Jesus, not because this is well,
but because we cannot do otherwise, because we feel that He has
loved us and we love Him in our turn."</p>
<p>Francis would not allow his monks to be called Friars; he
preferred Friars Minor or Little Brothers as a more humble
designation[<a href="#NOTE_F">F</a>].</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
<p>Ten years after the founding of the order, it is claimed, over
five thousand friars assembled in Rome for the general chapter. The
monks lodged in huts made of matting and hence this convention has
been called the "Chapter of Mats." The order was strongest
numerically about fifty years after the death of Francis, when it
numbered eight thousand convents and two hundred thousand monks.
Many of its members were highly distinguished, such as St.
Bonaventura, Duns Scotus, Roger Bacon and Cardinal Ximenes.</p>
<p>2. Nuns of St. Clara or Poor Claras, dates from 1212, but it did
not receive its rule from Francis until 1224. The order was founded
in the following manner: Clara, a daughter of a noble family, was
distinguished for her beauty and by her love for the poor. Francis
often met her, and, in the language of his biographer, "exhorted
her to a contempt of the world and poured into her ears the
sweetness of Christ." Guided, no doubt, by his counsel, she stole
one night from her home to a neighboring church where Francis and
his beggars were assembled. Her long and beautiful hair was cut
off, while a coarse woolen gown was <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page229"></a>[pg 229]</span> substituted for her own rich
garments. Standing in the midst of the ragged monks, she renounced
the dregs of Babylon and a wicked world, pledging her future to the
monastic institution. Out from this little church into the darkness
of the night, Francis led this beautiful girl of seventeen years
and committed her to a Benedictine nunnery. Later on Clara became
the abbess of a Franciscan convent at St. Damian, and the
Sisterhood of St. Clara was established. It was an order of sadness
and penitential tears. It is said that Clara never but once (when
she received the blessing of the pope) lifted her eyelids so that
the color of her eyes might be discerned.</p>
<p>3. The Third Order, called also "Brotherhood of Penitence," was
composed of lay men and women. So many husbands and wives were
desirous of leaving their homes in order to enter the monastic
state, that Francis, not wishing to break up happy marriages, so it
is said, was compelled to give these enthusiasts some sort of a
rule by which they might compromise between their established life
and the monastic career. This state of things led to the formation,
in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span>
1221, of the Third Order of St. Francis, or the Order of
Tertiaries, in relation to the Friars Minor and the Poor Claras.
Sabatier says this generally-accepted date is wrong; that it is
impossible to fix any date, for that which came to be known as the
Third Order was born of the enthusiasm excited by the preaching of
Francis soon after his return from Rome in 1210. Candidates for
admission into this order were required to make profession of all
the orthodox truths, special care being employed to guard against
the intrusion of heretics. Days of fasting and abstinence were
enjoined, and members were urged to avoid profanity, the theater,
dancing and law-suits. The order met with astonishing success,
cardinals, bishops, emperors, empresses, kings and queens, gladly
enrolling themselves among the followers of St. Francis.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Dominic_de_Guzman"></a>Dominic de Guzman, 1170-1221
A.D.</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Half-way between Osma and Aranda in Old Castile, Spain, is a
little village known as "the fortunate Calahorra." Here was the
castle of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>[pg
231]</span> Guzmans, where Dominic was born. His family was of high
rank and character, a noble house of warriors, statesmen and
saints. If we accept the legends, his greatness was foreshadowed.
Before his birth, his mother dreamed she saw her son under the
figure of a black-and-white dog, with a torch in his mouth. "A true
dream," says Milman, "for he will scent out heresy and apply the
torch to the faggots;" but, as will be seen later, this observation
does not rest on undisputed evidence.</p>

<b>Saint Dominic.</b><br>

in his cell in the convent of Santa Sabina, at Rome<br>
Trenton: Albert Brandt, Publisher, 1900]</p>
<br>
<p>In the year 1191, when Spain was desolated by a terrible famine,
Dominic was just finishing his theological studies. He gave away
his money and sold his clothes, his furniture and even his precious
manuscripts, that he might relieve distress. When his companions
expressed astonishment that he should sell his books, Dominic
replied: "Would you have me study off these dead skins, when men
are dying of hunger?" This noble utterance is cherished by his
admirers as the first saying from his lips that has passed to
posterity.</p>
<p>Dominic was educated in the schools of Palencia, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span> afterwards a
university, where he devoted six years to the arts and four to
theology. In 1194, when twenty-five years of age, Dominic became a
canon regular, at Osma, under the rule of St. Augustine. Nine years
after he accompanied his bishop, Don Diego, on an embassy for the
king of Castile. When they crossed the Pyrenees they found
themselves in an atmosphere of heresy. The country was filled with
preachers of strange doctrines, who had little respect for Dominic,
his bishop, or their Roman pontiff. The experiences of this journey
inspired in Dominic a desire to aid in the extermination of heresy.
He was also deeply impressed by an important and significant
observation. Many of these heretical preachers were not ignorant
fanatics, but well-trained and cultured men. Entire communities
seemed to be possessed by a desire for knowledge and for
righteousness. Dominic clearly perceived that only preachers of a
high order, capable of advancing reasonable argument, could
overthrow the Albigensian heresy.</p>
<p>It would be impossible, in a few words, to tell the whole story
of this Albigensian movement. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page233"></a>[pg 233]</span> Undoubtedly the term stood for a
variety of theological opinions, all of which were in opposition to
the teachings of Rome. "From the very invectives of their enemies,"
says Hallam, "and the acts of the Inquisition, it is manifest that
almost every shade of heterodoxy was found among these dissidents,
till it vanished in a simple protestation against the wealth and
tyranny of the clergy." Many of the tenets of these enthusiasts
were undoubtedly borrowed from the ancient Manicheism, and would be
pronounced heretical by every modern evangelical denomination. But
associated with those holding such doctrines were numerous
reformers, whose chief offense consisted in their incipient
Protestantism. However heretical any of these sects may have been,
it is impossible to make them out enemies to the social order,
except as all opponents of established religious traditions create
disturbance. "What these bodies held in common," says Hardwick,
"and what made them equally the prey of the inquisitor, was their
unwavering belief in the corruption of the medieval church,
especially as governed by the Roman pontiffs."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span>
<p>In 1208 Dominic visited Languedoc a second time, and on his way
he encountered the papal legates returning in pomp to Rome, foiled
in their attempt to crush this growing schism. To them he
administered his famous rebuke: "It is not the display of power and
pomp, cavalcades of retainers, and richly-houseled palfreys, or by
gorgeous apparel, that the heretics win proselytes; it is by
zealous preaching, by apostolic humility, by austerity, by seeming,
it is true, but by seeming holiness. Zeal must be met by zeal,
humility by humility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching
falsehood by preaching truth." It is extremely unfortunate for the
reputation of Dominic that he ever departed from the spirit of
these noble words, which so clearly state the conditions of true
religious progress.</p>
<p>Dominic now gathered about him a few men of like spirit and
began his task of preaching down heresy. But "the enticing words of
man's wisdom" failed to win the Albigensians from what they
believed to be the words of God. So, unmindful of his admonition to
the papal legates, Dominic obtained permission of Innocent III. to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span> hold
courts, before which he might summon all persons suspected of
heresy. When eloquence and courts failed, the pope let loose the
"dogs of war." Then followed twenty years of frightful carnage,
during which hundreds of thousands of heretics were slain, and many
cities were laid waste by fire and sword. "This was to punish a
fanaticism," says Hallam, "ten thousand times more innocent than
their own, and errors which, according to the worst imputations,
left the laws of humanity and the peace of social life unimpaired."
Peace was concluded in 1229, but the persecution of heretics went
on.</p>
<p>What part Dominic personally had in these bloody proceedings is
litigated history. His admirers strive to rescue his memory from
the charge that he was "a cruel and bloody man." It is argued that
while the pope and temporal princes carried on the sanguinary war
against the heretics, Dominic confined himself to pleading with
them in a spirit of true Christian love. He was a minister of
mercy, not an avenging angel, sword in hand. It has to be conceded
that the constant tradition of the Dominican <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span> order that Dominic
was the first Inquisitor, whether he bore the title or not, rests
upon good authority. But what was the nature of the office as held
by the saint? As far as Dominic was concerned, it is argued by his
friends that the office "was limited to the <i>reconciliation</i>
of heretics and had nothing to do with their <i>punishment</i>." It
is also claimed that while Dominic did impose penances, in some
cases public flagellation, no evidence can be produced showing that
he ever delivered one heretic to the flames. Those who were burned
were condemned by secular courts, and on the ground that they were
not only heretics but enemies of the public peace and perpetrators
of enormous crimes.</p>
<p>But while it may not be proved that Dominic himself passed the
sentence of death or applied the torch to the faggots with his own
hand, he is by no means absolved from all complicity in those
frightful slaughters, or from all responsibility for the subsequent
establishment of the Holy Inquisition. The principles governing the
Inquisition were practically those upon which Dominic proceeded;
the germs of the later atrocities are <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span> to be found in his
aims and methods. By what a narrow margin does Dominic escape the
charge of cruelty when it is boasted "that he resolutely insisted
on no sentence being carried out until all means had been tried by
which the conversion of a prisoner could be effected." Another
statement also contains an inkling of a significant fact, namely,
that secular judges and princes were constantly under the influence
of the monks and other ecclesiastical persons, who incited them to
wage war, and to massacre, in the Albigensian war as in other
crusades against heresy. No word from Dominic can be produced
indicating that he remonstrated with the pope, or that he tried to
stop the crusade. In a few instances he seems to have interceded
with the crazed soldiery for the lives of women and children. But
he did not oppose the bloody crusade itself. He was constantly
either with the army or following in its wake. He often sat on the
bench at the trial of dissenters. He remained the life-long friend
of Simon de Montfort, the cruel agent of the papacy, and he blessed
the marriage of his sons and baptized his daughter. Special courts
for trying heretics were established, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span> previous to the
more complete organization of the Inquisition, and in these he held
a commission.</p>
<p>The Holy Office of the Inquisition was made a permanent tribunal
by Gregory IX., in 1233, twelve years after the death of Dominic,
and curiously enough, in the same year in which he was canonized.
The Catholic Bollandists claim that although the <i>title</i> of
Inquisitor was of later date than Dominic, yet the <i>office</i>
was in existence, and that the splendor of the Holy Inquisition
owes its beginning to that saint. Certain it is that the
administration of the Inquisition was mainly in the hands of
Dominican monks.</p>
<p>In view of all these facts, Professor Allen is justified in his
conclusions respecting Dominic and his share in the persecution of
heretics: "Whatever his own sweet and heavenly spirit according to
Catholic eulogists, his name is a synonym of bleak and intolerant
fanaticism. It is fatally associated with the blackest horrors of
the crusade against the Albigenses, as well as with the infernal
skill and deadly machinery of the Inquisition."</p>
<p>In 1214, Dominic established himself, with six followers, in the
house of Peter Cellani, a rich <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page239"></a>[pg 239]</span> resident of Toulouse. Eleven years of
active and public life had passed since the Subprior of Osma had
forsaken the quietude of the monastery. He now resumed his life of
retirement and subjected himself and his companions to the monastic
rules of prayer and penance. But the restless spirit of the man
could not long remain content with the seclusion and inactivity of
a monk's life. The scheme of establishing an order of Preaching
Friars began to assume definite shape in his mind. He dreamed of
seven stars enlightening the world, which represented himself and
his six friends. The final result of his deliberations was the
organization of his order, and the appearance of Dominic in the
city of Rome, in 1215, to secure the approval of the pope, Innocent
III. Although some describe his reception as "most cordial and
flattering," yet it required supernatural interference to induce
the pope to grant even his approval of the new order. It was not
formally confirmed until 1216 by Honorius III.</p>
<p>Dominic now made his headquarters at Rome, although he traveled
extensively in the interests of his growing brotherhood of monks.
He was made <span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>[pg
240]</span> Master of the Sacred Palace, an important official
post, including among its functions the censorship of the press. It
has ever since been occupied by members of the Dominican order.</p>
<p>Throughout his life Dominic is said to have zealously practiced
rigorous self-denial. He wore a hair shirt, and an iron chain
around his loins, which he never laid aside, even in sleep. He
abstained from meat and observed stated fasts and periods of
silence. He selected the worst accommodations and the meanest
clothes, and never allowed himself the luxury of a bed. When
traveling, he beguiled the journey with spiritual instruction and
prayers. As soon as he passed the limits of towns and villages, he
took off his shoes, and, however sharp the stones or thorns, he
trudged on his way barefooted. Rain and other discomforts elicited
from his lips nothing but praises to God.</p>
<p>Death came at the age of fifty-one and found him exhausted with
the austerities and labors of his eventful career. He had reached
the convent of St. Nicholas, at Bologna, weary and sick with a
fever. He refused the repose of a bed and bade the monks lay him on
some sacking stretched upon <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page241"></a>[pg 241]</span> the ground. The brief time that
remained to him was spent in exhorting his followers to have
charity, to guard their humility, and to make their treasure out of
poverty. Lying in ashes upon the floor he passed away at noon, on
the sixth of August, 1221. He was canonized by Gregory IX., in
1234.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Dominican_Orders"></a>The Dominican
Orders</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The origin of the Order of the Preaching Friars has already been
described. It is not necessary to dwell upon the constitution of
this order, because in all essential respects it was like that of
the Franciscans. The order is ruled by a general and is divided
into provinces, governed by provincials. The head of each house is
called a prior. Dominic adopted the rules laid down by St.
Augustine, because the pope ordered him to follow some one of the
older monastic codes, but he also added regulations of his own.</p>
<p>Soon after the founding of the order, bands of monks were sent
out to Paris, to Rome, to Spain and to England, for the purpose of
planting colonies in the chief seats of learning. The order
produced <span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>[pg
242]</span> many eminent scholars, some of whom were Thomas
Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, Echard, Tauler and Savonarola.</p>
<p>As among the Franciscans, there was also an Order of Nuns,
founded in 1206, and a Third Order, called the Militia of Jesus
Christ, which was organized in 1218.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Success_of_the_Mendicant_Orders"></a>The
Success of the Mendicant Orders</i></h2>
<br>
<p>In 1215, Innocent III. being pope, the Lateran council passed
the following law: "Whereas the excessive diversity of these
[monastic] institutions begets confusion, no new foundations of
this sort must be formed for the future; but whoever wishes to
become a monk must attach himself to some of the already existing
rules." This same pope approved the two Mendicant orders, urging
them, it is true, to unite themselves to one of the older orders;
but, nevertheless, they became distinct organizations, eclipsing
all previous societies in their achievements. The reason for this
disregard of the Lateran decree is doubtless to be found in the
alarming condition of religious affairs at that time, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span> and in the hope
held out to Rome by the Mendicants, of reforming the monasteries
and crushing the heretics.</p>
<p>The failure of the numerous and varied efforts to reform the
monastic institution and the danger to the church arising from the
unwonted stress laid upon poverty by different schismatic religious
societies, necessitated the adoption of radical measures by the
church to preserve its influence. At this juncture the Mendicant
friars appeared. The conditions demanded a modification of the
monastic principle which had hitherto exalted a life of retirement.
Seclusion in the cloister was no longer possible in the view of the
remarkable changes in religious thought and practice.</p>
<p>Innocent III. was wise enough to perceive the immediate utility
of the new societies based upon claims to extraordinary humility
and poverty. The Mendicant orders were, in themselves, not only a
rebuke to the luxurious indolence and shameful laxity of the older
orders, but when sanctioned by the church, the existence of the new
societies attested Rome's desire to maintain the highest and the
purest standards of monastic life. Hence, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span> the Preaching
Friars were permitted to reproach the clergy and the monks for
their vices and corruptions.</p>
<p>"The effect of such a band of missionaries," says John Stuart
Mill, "must have been great in rousing and feeding dormant
devotional feelings. They were not less influential in regulating
those feelings, and turning into the established Catholic channels
those vagaries of private enthusiasm which might well endanger the
church, since they already threatened society itself."</p>
<p>Two novel monastic features, therefore, now appear for the first
time: 1. The substitution of itineracy for the seclusion of the
cloister; and 2. The abolition of endowments.</p>
<p>1. The older orders had their traveling missionaries, but the
general practice was to remain shut up within the monastic walls.
The Mendicants at the start had no particular abiding place, but
were bound to travel everywhere, preaching and teaching. It was
distinctly the mission of these monks to visit the camps, the
towns, cities and villages, the market places, the universities,
the homes and the churches, to preach and to minister to the sick
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> the
poor. They neither loved the seclusion of the cell nor sought it.
Theirs to tramp the dusty roads, with their capacious bags, begging
and teaching. Only by this itinerant method could the people be
reached and the preachers of heresy be encountered.</p>
<p>2. One of the chief sources of strength in the heretical sects
was the justness of their attack upon the Catholic monastic orders,
whose immense riches belied their vows of poverty. The heretics
practiced austerities and adopted a simplicity of life that won the
hearts of the people, by reason of its contrast to the loose habits
of the monks and clergy. Since it was impossible to reform the
older orders, it became absolutely essential to the success of the
Mendicants that they should rigorously respect the neglected
discipline. As the abuse of the vow of poverty was particularly
common, the Mendicants naturally emphasized this vow.</p>
<p>While it is true that a begging monk was by no means unknown,
yet now, for the first time, was the practice of mendicity formally
adopted by entire orders. Owing to the excessive multiplication of
mendicant societies, Pope Gregory X., at a general <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span> council held at
Lyons in 1272, attempted to check the growing evil. The number of
Mendicant orders was confined to four, viz., the Dominicans, the
Franciscans, the Carmelites and the Augustinians or Hermits of
Augustine. The Council of Trent confined mendicity to the
Observantines and Capuchins, since the other societies had
practically abandoned their original interpretation of their vow of
poverty and had acquired permanent property.</p>
<p>When Francis tried to enforce the rule of poverty, his rigor
gave rise to most serious dissensions, which began in his own
lifetime and ended after his death in open schism. Some of his
followers were not pleased with his views on that subject. They
resisted his extreme strictness, and after his death they continued
to advocate the holding of property. The popes tried to settle the
quarrel, but ever and anon it broke out afresh with volcanic
fierceness. They finally interpreted the rule of poverty to mean
that the friars could not hold property in their own names, but
they might enjoy its use. Under this interpretation of the rule,
the beggars soon became very rich. Matthew of Paris said: "The
friars who have been founded hardly forty years have built even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span> in the
present day in England residences as lofty as the palaces of our
kings." But the better element among the Franciscans refused to
consent to such a palpable evasion of the rule. A portion of this
class separated themselves from the Franciscans, rejected their
authority, and formed a new sect called the <i>Fratricelli</i>, or
Little Brothers. It is very important to keep the history of this
name clearly in mind, for it frequently appears in the Reformation
period and has been the cause of much misunderstanding. The word
"Fratricelli" came to be a term of derision applied to any one
affecting the dress or the habits of the monks. When heretical
sects arose, it was applied to them as a stigma, but it was used
first by a sect of rigid Franciscans who deserted their order,
adopted this name as their own, and exulted in its use. The quarrel
among the monks led to a variety of complications and is
intricately interwoven with the political and religious history of
the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. "These
rebellious Franciscans," says Mosheim, "though fanatical and
superstitious in some respects, deserve an eminent rank among those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span> who
prepared the way for the Reformation in Europe, and who excited in
the minds of the people a just aversion to Rome."</p>
<p>The Mendicants were especially active in educational work. This
is to be attributed to several causes. Unquestionably the general
and increasing interest in theological doctrines and the craving
for knowledge affected the monastic orders. Europe was just
arousing from her medieval slumbers. The faint rays of the
Reformation dawn were streaking the horizon. The intellect as well
as the conscience was touched by the Spirit of God. The revolt
against moral iniquity was often accompanied by skepticism
concerning the authority and dogmas of the church. Questions were
being asked that ignorant monks could not answer. Too long had the
church ignored these symptoms of the approach of a new order of
things. The church was forced to meet the heretics on their own
ground, to offset the example of their simplicity and purity of
life by exalting the neglected standards of self-denial, and to
silence them, if possible, by exposing their errors. Then came the
Franciscans, with their austere simplicity and their insistence
upon poverty. Then also appeared the Dominicans, or as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>[pg 249]</span> called,
"The Watch-dogs of the Church," who not only barked the church
awake, but tried to devour the heretics.</p>
<p>Francis halted for some time before giving encouragement to
educational enterprises. A life of devotion and prayer attracted
him, because, as he said, "Prayer purifies the affections,
strengthens us in virtue, and unites us to the sovereign good."
But, he went on, "Preaching renders the feet of the spiritual man
dusty; it is an employment which dissipates and distracts, and
which causes regular discipline to be relaxed." After consulting
Brother Sylvester and Sister Clara, he decided to adopt their
counsel and entered upon a ministry of preaching. The example and
success of the Dominicans probably inspired the Franciscans to give
themselves more and more to intellectual work.</p>
<p>Both orders received appointments in all the leading
universities, but they did not gain this ascendency without a
severe conflict. The regular professors and the clergy were jealous
of them for various causes, and resisted them at every point. The
quarrel between the Dominicans and the University of Paris is the
most famous of these <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page250"></a>[pg 250]</span> struggles. It began in 1228 and did
not end until 1259. The Dominicans claimed the right to two
theological professorships. One had been taken from them, and a law
was passed that no religious order should have what these friars
demanded. The Dominicans rebelled and the University passed
sentences of expulsion. Innocent IV., wishing to become master of
Italy, sided with the University, but the next month he was
dead,--in answer to their prayers, said the Dominicans, but rumor
hinted an even blacker cause. The thirty-one years of the struggle
dragged wearily on, disturbed by papal bulls, appeals, pamphlets
and university slogans. At last Alexander IV., in 1255, decided
that the Dominicans might have the second professorship and also
any other they thought proper. The noise of conflict now grew
louder and boded ill for the peace of the church. The pulpits
flashed forth fiery utterances. The monks were assailed in every
quarter. William of Amour published his essay on "The Perils of the
Last Times," in which he claimed that the perilous times predicted
by the Apostle Paul were now fulfilled by these begging friars. He
exposed their iniquities and bitterly <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span> complained of their
arrogance and vice. His book was burned and its author banished.
Although meaning to be a friend of Rome, he unconsciously
contributed his share to the coming reform. In 1259, Rome thundered
so loud that all Europe was terrified and the University was awed
into submission.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature in the history of their educational
enterprises is the entrance of the Mendicants into England, where
they acted a leading part in the educational and political history
of the country. The Dominicans settled first at Oxford, in 1221.
The Franciscans, after a short stay at Canterbury, went to Oxford
in 1224. The story of how the two Gray friars journeyed from
Canterbury to Oxford runs as follows: "These two forerunners of a
famous brotherhood, being not far from Oxford, lost their way and
came to a farmhouse of the Benedictines. It was nearly night and
raining. They gently knocked, and asked admittance for God's sake.
The porter gazed on their patched robes and beggarly aspect and
supposed them to be mimics or despised persons. The prior, pleased
with the tidings, invited them in. But instead of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span> sportively
performing, these two friars insisted, with sedate countenances,
that they were men of God. Whereat the Benedictines in jealousy,
and displeased to be cheated out of their expected fun, kicked and
buffeted the two poor monks and turned them out of doors. One young
monk pitied them and smuggled them into a hay-loft where we trust
they slept soundly and safe from the cold and rain." The two friars
finally reached Oxford and were well received by their Dominican
brothers. Such was the simple beginning of a brilliant career that
was profoundly to affect the course of English history. Both at
Cambridge and Oxford the monastic orders exercised a remarkable
influence. Traces of their labors and power may still be seen in
the names of the colleges, and in the religious portions of the
university discipline. They built fine edifices and manned their
schools with the best teachers, so that they became great rivals of
the regular colleges which did not have the funds necessary to
compete with these wealthy beggars. Another cause of their rapid
progress was the exodus of students from Paris to England. During
the quarrel at Paris, Henry III. of England offered many
inducements to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>[pg
253]</span> students, who left for England in large numbers. Many
of them were prejudiced in favor of the friars, and they naturally
drifted to the monastic college. The secular clergy charged the
friars with inducing the college students to enter the monasteries
or to turn begging monks. The pope, the king, and the parliament
became involved in the struggle, which grew more bitter as the
years passed. After a while Wyclif appeared, and when he began his
mighty attack upon the friars the joy with which the professors
viewed the struggle can be appreciated.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Decline_of_the_Mendicants"></a>The Decline of
the Mendicants</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The Mendicant friars won their fame by faithful and earnest
labors. Men admired them because they identified themselves with
the lowest of mankind and heroically devoted themselves to the poor
and sick. These "sturdy beggars," as Francis called his companions,
were contrasted with the lazy, rich, and, too often, licentious
monks of the other orders. Everywhere the friars were received with
veneration and joy. The people sought burial in <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span> their rags,
believing that, clothed in the garments of these holy beggars, they
would enter paradise more speedily.</p>
<p>Instead of seeking the seclusion of the convent to save his own
soul, the friar displayed remarkable zeal trying to save mankind.
He became the arbiter in the quarrels of princes, the prime mover
in treaties between nations, and the indispensable counselor in
political complications. The pope employed him as his authorized
agent in the most difficult matters touching the welfare of the
church. His influence upon the common people is thus described by
the historian Green: "The theory of government wrought out in the
cell and lecture-room was carried over the length and breadth of
the land by the Mendicant brother begging his way from town to
town, chatting with the farmer or housewife at the cottage door and
setting up his portable pulpit in village green or market-place.
The rudest countryman learned the tale of a king's oppression or a
patriot's hope as he listened to the rambling, passionate, humorous
discourse of the beggar friar."</p>
<p>By these methods the Mendicants were enabled <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span> to render most
efficient service to their patrons at Rome in their efforts to
establish their temporal power. They were, in fact, before the
Reformation, just what the Jesuits afterwards became, "the very
soul of the hierarchy." Yes, they were immensely, prodigiously
successful. The popes hastened to do them honor. Because the friars
were such enthusiastic supporters of the church, the popes poured
gold and privileges into their capacious coffers. Thankful peasants
threw in their mites and the admiring noble bestowed his
estates.</p>
<p>The secular clergy, with envy and chagrin, awoke to the alarming
fact that the beggars had won the hearts of the people; their
hatred was increased by the fact that when the Roman pontiffs
enriched these indefatigable toilers and valiant foes of heresy,
they did so at the expense of the bishops and clergy, which,
perhaps, was robbing Paul to pay Peter.</p>
<p>Baluzii says: "No religious order had the distribution of so
many and such ample indulgences as the Franciscans. In place of
fixed revenues, lucrative indulgences were placed in their hands."
So ill-judged was the distribution of these favors that discipline
was overturned. Many churchmen, feeling <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span> that their rights
were being encroached upon, complained bitterly, and resolved on
retaliation. It is just here that a potent cause of the Mendicant's
fall is to be found. He helped to dig his own grave.</p>
<p>Having elevated monasticism to the zenith of its power, the
Mendicant orders, like all the other monastic brotherhoods, entered
upon their shameful decline. The unexampled prosperity, so
inconsistent with the original intentions of the founders of the
orders, was attended by corruptions and excesses. The decrees of
councils, the denunciations of popes and high ecclesiastical
dignitaries, the satires of literature, the testimony of
chroniclers and the formation of reformatory orders, constitute a
body of irrefragable evidence proving that the lowest level of
sensuality, superstition and ignorance had been reached. The monks
and friars lost whatever vigor and piety they ever possessed.</p>
<p>It is again evident that a monk cannot serve God and mammon.
Success ruins him. Wealth and popular favor change his character.
The people slowly realize the fact that the fat and lazy medieval
monk is not dead, after all, but <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page257"></a>[pg 257]</span> has simply changed his name to that
of Begging Friar. As Allen neatly observes: "Their gray gown and
knotted cord wrapped a spiritual pride and capacity of bigotry,
fully equal to the rest."</p>
<p>Here, then, are the "sturdy beggars" of Francis, dwelling in
palatial convents, arrogant and proud, trampling their ideal into
the dust. Thus it came to pass in accordance with the principle
stated at the beginning of this chapter, that when the ideal became
a cloak to cover up sham, decay had set in, and ruin, even though
delayed for years, was sure to come. The poor, sad-faced, honest,
faithful friar everybody praised, loved and reverenced. The
insolent, contemptuous, rich monk all men loathed. So a change of
character in the friar transformed the songs of praise into shouts
of condemnation. Those golden rays from the morning sun of the
Reformation are ascending toward the highest heaven, and daybreak
is near.</p>

<h2><i><a name="THE_SOCIETY_OF_JESUS"></a>THE SOCIETY OF
JESUS</i></h2>
<br>
<p>In many respects it would be perfectly proper to consider the
Mendicant orders as the last stage in the evolution of the monastic
institution. Although the Jesuitical system rests upon the three
vows of poverty, celibacy and obedience, yet the ascetic principle
is reduced to a minimum in that society. Father Thomas E. Sherman,
the son of the famous general, and a Jesuit of distinguished
ability, has declared: "We are not, as some seem to think, a
semi-military band of men, like the Templars of the Middle Ages. We
are not a monastic order, seeking happiness in lonely withdrawal
from our fellows. Our enemies within and without the church would
like to make us monks, for then we would be comparatively useless,
since that is not our end or aim.... We are regulars in the army of
Christ; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span>
that is, men vowed to poverty, chastity and obedience; we are a
collegiate body with the right to teach granted by the Catholic
church[<a href="#NOTE_G"></a>G]."</p>
<p>The early religious orders were based upon the idea of
retirement from the world for the purpose of acquiring holiness.
But as has already been shown, the constant tendency of the
religious communities was toward participation in the world's
affairs. This tendency became very marked among the friars, who
traveled from place to place, and occupied important university
positions, and it reaches its culmination in the Society of Jesus.
Retirement among the Jesuits is employed merely as a preparation
for active life. Constant intercourse with society was provided for
in the constitution of the order. Bishop John J. Keane, a Roman
Catholic authority, says: "The clerks regular, instituted
principally since the sixteenth century, were neither monks nor
friars, but priests living in common and busied with the work of
the ministry. The Society of Jesus is one of the orders of clerks
regular."</p>
<p>Other differences between the monastic communities <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span> and the Jesuits are
to be observed. The Jesuit discards the monastic gown, and is
decidedly averse to the old monastic asceticism, with its rigorous
and painful treatment of the body. While the older religious
societies were essentially democratic in spirit and government, the
monks sharing in the control of the monastic property and
participating in the election of superiors, the Jesuitical system
is intensely monarchical, a despotism pure and simple. In the older
orders, the welfare of the individual was jealously guarded and his
sanctification was sought. Among the Jesuits the individual is
nothing, the corporate body everything. Admission to the monastic
orders was encouraged and easily obtained. The novitiate of the
Jesuits is long and difficult. Access to the highest grades of the
order is granted only to those who have served the society many
weary years.</p>

<p>But in spite of such variations from the old monastic type, the
Society of Jesus would doubtless never have appeared, had not the
way for its existence been paved by previous monastic societies.
Its aims and its methods were the natural sequence of monastic
history. They were merely a development <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span> of past
experiences, for the objects of the society were practically the
objects of the Mendicants; the vows were the same with a change of
emphasis. The abandonment of austerities as a means of salvation or
spiritual power was the natural fruit of past experiments that had
proved the uselessness of asceticism merely for the sake of
acquiring a spirit of self-denial. The extirpation of heresy
undertaken by Ignatius had already been attempted by the friars,
while the education of the young had long been carried on with
considerable success by the Benedictine and Dominican monks. The
spirit of its founder, however, gave the Society of Jesus a unique
character, and monasticism now passed out from the cell forever.
The Jesuit may fairly be regarded as a monk, unlike any of his
predecessors but nevertheless the legitimate fruit of centuries of
monastic experience.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Ignatius_de_Loyola"></a>Ignatius de Loyola,
1491-1556 A.D.</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Inigo Lopez de Recalde, or Loyola, as he is commonly known, was
born at Guipuzcoa, in Spain, in 1491. He was educated as a page in
the court <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>[pg
262]</span> of Ferdinand the Catholic. He afterwards became a
soldier and led a very wild life until his twenty-ninth year.
During the siege of Pamplona, in 1521, he was severely wounded, and
while convalescing he was given lives of Christ and of the saints
to read. His perusal of these stories of spiritual combat inspired
a determination to imitate the glorious achievements of the saints.
For a while the thirst for military renown and an attraction toward
a lady of the court, restrained his spiritual impulses. But
overcoming these obstacles, he resolutely entered upon his new
career.</p>
<p>Sometime after he visited the sanctuary of Montserrat, where he
hung his shield and sword upon the altar of the Virgin Mary and
gave his oath of fealty to the service of God. A tablet, erected by
the abbot of the monastery in commemoration of this event, reads as
follows: "Here, blessed Ignatius of Loyola, with many prayers and
tears, devoted himself to God and the Virgin. Here, as with
spiritual arms, he fortified himself in sackcloth, and spent the
vigil of the night. Hence he went forth to found the Society of
Jesus, in the year MDXXII."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>
<p>After spending ten months in Manresa, Loyola went on a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, intending to remain there, but he was
sent home by the Eastern monks, and reached Italy in 1524.</p>
<p>Now began his struggle for an education. At the age of
thirty-three he took his seat on the school-bench at Barcelona. In
1526 he entered the University at Alcala. He was here looked upon
as a dangerous innovator, and was imprisoned six weeks, by order of
the Inquisition, for preaching without authority, since he was not
in holy orders. After his release he attended the University of
Salamanca, but he finally took his degree of Master of Arts at the
University of Paris, in 1533.</p>
<p>During this period he was several times imprisoned as a
dangerous fanatic, but each time he succeeded in securing a verdict
in his favor. The hostility to Ignatius and his work forms a
strange parallel to the bitter antagonism which his society has
always encountered.</p>
<p>Nine men, among whom was Francis Xavier, afterwards widely
renowned, had been chosen with great care, as the companions of
Ignatius. He called them together in July, 1534, and on August
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span> 15th of
the same year he selected six of them and bade them follow him to
the Church of the Blessed Virgin, at Montmartre, in Paris. There
and then they bound themselves to renounce all their goods, and to
make a voyage to Jerusalem, in order to convert the Eastern
infidels; if that scheme proved impracticable, they agreed to offer
themselves to the sovereign pontiff for any service he might
require of them. War prevented the journey to the Holy Land, and
so, after passing through a variety of experiences, Ignatius and
his companions met at Rome, to secure the sanction of Pope Paul
III. for the new society. After a year and a half of deliberation
and discussion a favorable decision was reached, which was, no
doubt, partly facilitated by the growth of the Reformation. The new
society was chartered on September 27, 1540, for the "defence and
advance of the faith."</p>
<p>Ignatius was elected as the general of the order and entered
upon his duties, April 17, 1541. He soon prepared a constitution
which was not adopted until after his death, and then in an amended
form. Loyola ended his remarkable and stormy career, July 31,
1556.</p>

<h2><i><a name=
"Constitution_and_Polity_of_the_Order"></a>Constitution and Polity
of the Order</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The <i>Institutum</i>, which contains the governing laws of the
society, is a complex document consisting of papal bulls and
decrees, a list of the privileges which have been granted to the
order, ten chapters of rules, decrees of the general congregations,
the plan of studies (<i>ratio studiorum</i>), and three ascetic
writings, of which the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius constitute
the chief part.</p>
<p>The society is distributed into six grades: novices,
scholastics, temporal coadjutors, spiritual coadjutors, professed
of the three vows, and professed of the four vows.</p>
<p>The professed form only a small percentage of the entire body,
and constitute a sort of religious aristocracy, from which the
officers of the society are selected. Only the professed of the
fourth vow, who add to the three vows a pledge of unconditional
obedience to the pope, possess the full rights of membership. This
final grade cannot be reached until the age of forty-five, so that
if the candidate enters the order at the earliest age <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>[pg 266]</span> permissible,
fourteen, he has been on probation thirty-one years when he reaches
the final grade.</p>
<p>The society is ruled by a general, to whom unconditional
obedience is required. The provinces, into which the order is
divided, are governed by provincials, who must report monthly to
the general. The heads of all houses and colleges must report
weekly to their provincials. An elaborate system of checks and
espionage is employed to ensure the perfect working of this complex
ecclesiastical machinery. Fraud or evasion is carefully guarded
against, and every possible means is employed to enable the general
to keep himself fully informed concerning the minutest details of
the society's affairs.</p>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Vow_of_Obedience"></a>The Vow of
Obedience</i></h2>
<p>That which has imparted a peculiar character to the Jesuit and
contributed more than any other force to his success, is the
insistence upon unquestioning submission to the will of the
superior. This emphasis on the vow of obedience deserves,
therefore, special consideration. Loyola, in his <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>[pg 267]</span> "Spiritual
Exercises," commanded the novice to preserve his freedom of mind,
but it is difficult for the fairest critic to conceive of such a
possibility in the light of Loyola's rule of obedience, which
reads: "I ought not to be my own, but His who created me, and his
too by whose means God governs me, yielding myself to be moulded in
his hands like so much wax.... I ought to be like a corpse, which
has neither will nor understanding, or like a small crucifix, which
is turned about at the will of him who holds it, or like a staff in
the hands of an old man, who uses it as may best assist or please
him."</p>
<p>As an example of the kind of obedience demanded of the Jesuit,
Loyola cited the obedience of Abraham, who, when he believed that
Jehovah commanded him to commit the crime of infanticide, was ready
to obey. The thirteenth of the rules appended to the Spiritual
Exercises says: "If the Church shall have defined that to be black
which to our eyes appears white, we ought to pronounce the thing in
question black."</p>
<p>Loyola is reported as having said to his secretary that "in
those who offer themselves he looked less <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>[pg 268]</span> to purely natural
goodness than to firmness of character and ability for business."
But that he did not mean <i>independent</i> firmness of character
is clearly seen in the obvious attempt of the order to destroy that
noble and true independence which is the crowning glory of a lofty
character. The discipline is marvelously contrived to "scoop the
will" out of the individual. Count Paul von Hoensbroech, who
recently seceded from the society, has set forth his reasons for so
doing in two articles which appeared in the "Preussische
Jahrb&uuml;cher." A most interesting discussion of these articles,
in the "New World," for December, 1894, places the opinions of the
Count at our disposal. It is quite evident that he is no
passionate, blind foe of the society. His tone is temperate and his
praises cordially given. While recognizing the genius shown in the
machinery of the society and the nobility of the real aims of the
Jesuitical discipline, and while protesting against the unfounded
charges of impurity, and other gross calumnies against the order,
Count Paul nevertheless maintains that it "rests on so unworthy a
depreciation of individuality, and so exaggerated an apprehension
of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>[pg 269]</span>
virtue of obedience, as to render it unfit for its higher ends."
The uniform of the Jesuit is not an external garb, but such freedom
is insignificant in the light of the "veritable strait-jacket,"
which is placed upon the inward man. The unformed and pliable
novice, usually between the ages of sixteen and twenty, is
subjected to "a skillful, energetic and unremitting assault upon
personal independence." Every device that a shrewd and powerful
intellect could conceive of is employed to break up the personal
will. "The Jesuit scheme prescribes the gait, the way to hold the
hands, to incline the head, to direct the eyes, to hold and move
the person."</p>
<p>Every novice must go through the "Spiritual Exercises" in
complete solitude, twice in his life. They occupy thirty days. The
"Account of the Conscience" is of the very essence of Jesuitism.
The ordinary confession, familiar to every Catholic, is as nothing
compared with this marvelous inquiry into the secrets of the human
heart and mind. Every fault, sin, virtue, wish, design, act and
thought,--good, bad or indifferent,--must be disclosed, and this
revelation of the inner life may be used against him who makes it,
"for the good of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>[pg
270]</span> the order." Thus, after fifteen years of such ingenious
and detailed discipline, the young man's intellectual and moral
faculties are moulded into Jesuitical forms. He is no longer his
own. He is a pliable and obedient, even though it may be a virtuous
and brilliant, tool of a spiritual master-mechanic who will use him
according to his own purposes, in the interest of the society.</p>
<p>The Jesuits have signally failed to convince the world that the
type of character produced by their system is worthy of admiration.
The "sacrifice of the intellect"--a familiar watchword of the
Jesuit--is far too high a price to pay for whatever benefits the
discipline may confer. It is contrary to human nature, and hence to
the divine intention, to keep a human soul in a state of
subordination to another human will. As Von Hoensbroech says of the
society: "Who gave it a right to break down that most precious
possession of the individual being, which God gave, and which man
has no authority to take away?"</p>
<p>It is true that no human organization has so magnificently
brought to perfection a unity of purpose and oneness of will. It is
also true that a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>[pg
271]</span> spirit of defiance toward human authority is often
accompanied by a disobedience of divine law. But the remedy for the
abuses of human freedom is neither in the annihilation of the will
itself, nor in its mere subjection to some other will irrespective
of its moral character. Carlyle may have been too vehement in some
of his censures of Jesuitism, but he certainly exposed the
fallaciousness of Loyola's views concerning the value of mere
obedience, at the same time justly rebuking the too ardent admirers
of the perverted principle: "I hear much also of 'obedience,' how
that and kindred virtues are prescribed and exemplified by
Jesuitism; the truth of which, and the merit of which, far be it
from me to deny.... Obedience is good and indispensable: but if it
be obedience to what is wrong and false, good heavens, there is no
name for such a depth of human cowardice and calamity, spurned
everlastingly by the gods. Loyalty? Will you be loyal to Beelzebub?
Will you 'make a covenant with Death and Hell'? I will not be loyal
to Beelzebub; I will become a nomadic Choctaw rather, ... anything
and everything is venial to that."</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Casuistry_of_the_Jesuits"></a>The Casuistry of
the Jesuits</i></h2>
<br>
<p>It is often asserted, even by authoritative writers, that a
Jesuit is bound by his vows to commit either venial or mortal sin
at the command of his superior; and that the maxim, "The end
justifies the means," has not only been the principle upon which
the society has prosecuted its work but is also explicitly taught
in the rules of the order. There is nothing in the constitution of
the society to justify these two serious charges, which are not to
be regarded as malicious calumnies, however, because the slovenly
Latin in one of the rules on obedience has misled such competent
scholars as John Addington Symonds and the historian Ranke.
Furthermore, judging from the doctrines of the society as set forth
by many of their theologians and the political conduct of its
representatives, the conclusion seems inevitable that while the
society may not teach in its rules that its members are bound to
obedience even to the point of sin, yet practically many of its
leaders have so held and its emissaries have rendered that kind of
obedience.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>
<p>Bishop Keane admits that one of the causes for the decline and
overthrow of the society was its marked tendency toward lax moral
teaching. There can be but little doubt that the Jesuits have ever
been indulgent toward many forms of sin and even crime, when
committed under certain circumstances and for the good of the order
or "the greater glory of God."</p>
<p>To enable the reader to form some sort of an independent
judgment on this question, it is necessary to say a few words on
the subject of casuistry and the doctrine of probabilism.</p>
<p>Casuistry is the application of general moral rules to given
cases, especially to doubtful ones. The medieval churchmen were
much given to inventing fanciful moral distinctions and to
prescribing rules to govern supposable problems of conscience. They
were not willing to trust the individual conscience or to encourage
personal responsibility. The individual was taught to lean his
whole weight on his spiritual adviser, in other words, to make the
conscience of the church his own. As a result there grew up a
confused mass of precepts to guide the perplexed conscience. The
Jesuits carried this <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page274"></a>[pg 274]</span> system to its farthest extreme. As
Charles C. Starbuck says: "They have heaped possibility upon
possibility in their endeavors to make out how far there can be
subjective innocence in objective error, until they have, in more
than one fundamental point, hopelessly confused their own
perceptions of both[<a href="#NOTE_H">H</a>]."</p>
<p>The doctrine of probabilism is founded upon the distinctions
between opinions that are sure, less sure, or more sure. There are
several schools of probabilists, but the doctrine itself
practically amounts to this: Since uncertainty attaches to many of
our decisions in moral affairs, one must follow the more probable
rule, but not always, cases often arising when it is permissible to
follow a rule contrary to the more probable one. Furthermore, as
the Jesuits made war upon individual authority, which was the
key-note of the Reformation, and contended for the authority of the
church, the teaching naturally followed, that the opinion of "a
grave doctor" may be looked upon "as possessing a fair amount of
probability, and may, therefore, be safely followed, even though
one's conscience insist <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page275"></a>[pg 275]</span> upon the opposite course." It is easy
to see that this opens a convenient door to those who are seeking
justification for conduct which their consciences condemn. No doubt
one can find plausible excuses for the basest crimes, if he stills
the voice of conscience and trusts himself to confusing sophistry.
The glory of God, the gravity of circumstances, necessity, the good
of the church or of the order, and numerous other practical reasons
can be urged to remove scruples and make a bad act seem to be a
good one. But crime, even "for the glory of God," is crime
still.</p>
<p>This disagreeable subject will not be pursued further. To say
less than has been said would be to ignore one of the most
prominent causes of the Jesuits' ruin. To say more than this, even
though the facts might warrant it, would incur the liability of
being classed among those malicious fomentors of religious strife,
for whom the writer has mingled feelings of pity and contempt. The
Society of Jesus is not the Roman Catholic Church, which has
suffered much from the burden of Jesuitism--wounds that are
scarcely atoned for by the meritorious and self-sacrificing
services on her behalf in <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> other directions. The Protestant foes
have never equaled the Catholic opponents of Jesuitism, either in
their fierce hatred of the system or in their ability to expose its
essential weakness. A writer in the "Quarterly Review," September,
1848, says: "Admiration and detestation of the Jesuits divide, as
far as feeling is concerned, the Roman Catholic world, with a
schism deeper and more implacable than any which arrays Protestant
against Protestant."</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Mission_of_the_Jesuits"></a>The Mission of the
Jesuits</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The Society of Jesus has been described as "a naked sword, whose
hilt is at Rome, and whose point is everywhere." It is an
undisputed historical fact that Loyola's consuming passion was to
accomplish the ruin of Protestantism, which had twenty years the
start of him and was threatening the very existence of the Roman
hierarchy. It has already been shown that the destruction of heresy
was the chief aim of the Dominicans. What the friars failed to
attain, Loyola attempted. The principal object of the Jesuits was
the maintenance of papal authority. Even to-day the Jesuit does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span> not
hesitate to declare that his mission is to overthrow Protestantism.
The Reformation was inspired by a new conception of individual
freedom. The authority of tradition and of the church was set at
naught. Loyola planted his system upon the doctrine of absolute
submission to authority. The partial success of the Jesuits, for
they did beat back the Reformation, is no doubt attributable to
their fidelity, virtue and learning. Their devotion to the cause
they loved, their willingness to sacrifice life itself, their
marvelous and instantaneous obedience to the slightest command of
their leaders, made them a compact and powerful papal army. Their
methods, in many particulars, were not beyond question, and,
whatever their character, the order certainly incurred the fiercest
hostility of every nation in Europe, and even of the church
itself.</p>
<p>Professor Anton Gindely, in his "History of the Thirty Years'
War," shows that Maximilian, of Bavaria, and Ferdinand, of Austria,
the leaders on the Catholic side, were educated by Jesuits. He also
fixes the responsibility for that war partly upon them in the
plainest terms: "In a word, they had the consciences of Roman
Catholic sovereigns and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page278"></a>[pg 278]</span> their ministers in their hands as
educators, and in their keeping as confessors. They led them in the
direction of war, so that it was at the time, and has since been
called the Jesuits' War."</p>
<p>The strictures of Carlyle, Macaulay, Thackeray, and Lytton have
been repeatedly denounced by the Jesuits, but even their shrewd,
sophistical defences of their order afford ample justification for
the attitude of their foes. For example, in a masterful oration,
previously quoted from, in which the virtues of the Jesuits are
extolled and defended, Father Sherman says: "We are expelled and
driven from pillar to post because we teach men to love God." He
describes Loyola as "the knightly, the loyal, the true, the father
of heroes, and the maker of saints, the lover of the all-good and
the all-beautiful, crowned with the honor of sainthood, the
best-loved and the best-hated man in all the world, save only his
Master and ours." "'Twas he that conceived the daring plan of
forging the weapon to beat back the Reformation." No one but a
Jesuit could reconcile the aim of "preaching the love of God" with
"beating back the Reformation," especially in view of the methods
employed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>
<p>Numerous gross calumnies have been circulated against the
Society of Jesus. The dread of a return to that deplorable
intellectual and moral slavery of the pre-Reformation days is so
intense, that a calm, dispassionate consideration of Jesuit history
is almost impossible. But after all just concessions have been
made, two indisputable facts confront the student: first, the
universal antagonism to the order, of the church that gave birth to
it, as well as of the states that have suffered from its meddling
in political affairs; and second, the complete failure of the
order's most cherished schemes. France, Germany, Switzerland,
Spain, Great Britain and other nations, have been compelled in
sheer self-defence to expel it from their territories. Such a
significant fact needs some other explanation than that the Jesuit
has incurred the enmity of the world merely for preaching the love
of God.</p>
<p>Clement XIV., when solemnly pronouncing the dissolution of the
order, at the time his celebrated bull, entitled "<i>Dominus ac
Redemptor Noster</i>" which was signed July 21, 1773, was made
public, justified his action in the following terms: "Recognizing
that the members of this society have not a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span> little troubled the
Christian commonwealth, and that for the welfare of Christendom it
were better that the order should disappear," etc. When Rome thus
delivers her <i>ex cathedra</i> opinion concerning her own order,
an institution which she knows better than any one else, one cannot
fairly be charged with prejudice and sectarianism in speaking evil
of it.</p>
<p>But while there is much to be detested in the methods of the
order, history does not furnish another example of such
self-abnegation and intense zeal as the Jesuits have shown in the
prosecution of their aims. They planted missions in Japan, China,
Africa, Ceylon, Madagascar, North and South America.</p>
<p>In Europe the Mendicant friars by their coarseness had disgusted
the upper classes; the affable and cultured Jesuit won their
hearts. The Jesuits became chaplains in noble families, learned the
secrets of every government in Europe, and became the best
schoolmasters in the age. They were to be found in various
disguises in every castle of note and in every palace. "There was
no region of the globe," says Macaulay, "no walk of speculative or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span> active
life in which Jesuits were not to be found." That they were devoted
to their cause no one can deny. They were careless of life and, as
one facetiously adds, of truth also. They educated, heard
confessions, plotted crimes and revolutions, and published whole
libraries. Worn out by fatigue, the Jesuits still toiled on with
marvelous zeal. Though hated and opposed, they wore serene and
cheerful countenances. In a word, they had learned to control every
faculty and every passion, and to merge every human aspiration and
personal ambition into the one supreme purpose of conquering an
opposing faith and exalting the power of priestly authority. They
hold up before the subjects of the King of Heaven a wonderful
example of loving and untiring service, which should be emulated by
every servant of Christ who too often yields an indifferent
obedience to Him whom he professes to love and to serve.</p>
<p>Francis Parkman, in his brilliant narrative of "The Jesuits in
North America," presents the following interesting contrast between
the Puritan and the Jesuit: "To the mind of the Puritan, heaven was
God's throne; but no less was the earth His <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span> footstool; and each
in its degree and its kind had its demands on man. He held it a
duty to labor and to multiply; and, building on the Old Testament
quite as much as on the New, thought that a reward on earth as well
as in heaven awaited those who were faithful to the law. Doubtless,
such a belief is widely open to abuse, and it would be folly to
pretend that it escaped abuse in New England; but there was in it
an element manly, healthful and invigorating. On the other hand,
those who shaped the character, and in a great measure the destiny,
of New France had always on their lips the nothingness and the
vanity of life. For them, time was nothing but a preparation for
eternity, and the highest virtue consisted in a renunciation of all
the cares, toils and interests of earth. That such a doctrine has
often been joined to an intense worldliness, all history proclaims;
but with this we have at present nothing to do. If all mankind
acted on it in good faith, the world would sink into decrepitude.
It is the monastic idea carried into the wide field of active life,
and is like the error of those who, in their zeal to cultivate
their higher nature, suffer the neglected body to dwindle and pine,
till <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span>
body and mind alike lapse into feebleness and disease."</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the success of the Jesuits in stopping the
progress of the Reformation, it may be truthfully said that they
have failed. The principles of the Reformation dominate the world
and are slowly modifying the Roman church in America. "In truth,"
says Macaulay, "if society continued to hold together, if life and
property enjoyed any security, it was because common sense and
common humanity restrained men from doing what the order of Jesus
assured them they might with a safe conscience do." Our hope for
the future progress of society lies in the guiding power of this
same common sense and common humanity.</p>
<p>The restoration of the order by Pius VII., August 7th, 1814,
while it renewed the papal favor, did not allay the hostility of
the civil powers. Various states have expelled them since that
time, and wherever they labor, they are still the objects of open
attack or ill-disguised suspicion. Although the order still shows
"some quivering in fingers and toes," as Carlyle expresses it, the
principles of the Reformation are too widely believed, and its
benefits <span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>[pg
284]</span> too deeply appreciated, to justify any hope or fear of
the ultimate triumph of Jesuitism.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Retrospect"></a>Retrospect</i></h2>
<br>
<p>So the Christian monk has greatly changed since he first
appeared in the deserts of Nitria, in Egypt. He has come from his
den in the mountains to take his seat in parliaments, and find his
home in palaces. He is no longer filthy in appearance, but elegant
in dress and courtly in manner. He has exchanged his rags for
jewels and silks. He is no longer the recluse of the lonely cliffs,
chatting with the animals and gazing at the stars. He is a man of
the world, with schemes of conquest filling his brain and a love of
dominion ruling his heart. He is no longer a ditch-digger and a
ploughman, but the proud master of councils or the cultured
professor of the university. He still swears to the three vows of
celibacy, poverty and obedience, but they do not mean the same
thing to him that they did to the more ignorant, less cultured, but
more genuinely frank monk of the desert. Yes, he has all but
completely lost sight of his ancient monastic ideal. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>[pg 285]</span> He professes the
poverty of Christ, but he cannot follow even so simple a man as his
Saint Francis.</p>
<p>It is a long way from Jerome to Ignatius, but the end of the
journey is nigh. Loyola is the last type of monastic life, or
changing the figure, the last great leader in the conquered
monastic army. The good within the system will survive, its truest
exponents will still fire the courage and win the sympathy of the
devout, but best of all, man will recover from its poison.</p>

<h2><i><a name="THE_FALL_OF_THE_MONASTERIES"></a>THE FALL OF THE
MONASTERIES</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The rise of Protestantism accelerated the decline and final ruin
of the monasteries. The enthusiasm of the Mendicants and the
culture of the Jesuits failed to convince the governments of Europe
that monasticism was worthy to survive the destruction awaiting so
many medieval institutions. The spread of reformatory opinions
resulted in a determined and largely successful attack upon the
monasteries, which were rightly believed to constitute the bulwark
of papal power. So imperative were the popular demands for a
change, that popes and councils hastened to urge the members of
religious orders to abolish existing abuses by enforcing primitive
rules. But while Rome practically failed in her attempted
reformations, the Protestant reformers in church and state were
widely successful in either <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page287"></a>[pg 287]</span> curtailing the privileges and
revenues of the monks or in annihilating the monasteries.</p>
<p>Since the sixteenth century the leading governments of Europe,
even including those in Catholic countries, have given tangible
expression to popular and political antagonism to monasticism, by
the abolition of convents, or the withdrawal of immunities and
favors, for a long time a source of monastic revenue and power. The
results of this hostility have been so disastrous, that monasticism
has never regained its former prestige and influence. Several of
the older orders have risen from the ruins, and a few new
communities have appeared, some of which are distinguished by their
most laudable ministrations to the poor and the sick, or by their
educational services. Yet notwithstanding the modifications of the
system to suit the exigencies of modern times, it seems altogether
improbable that the monks will ever again wield the power they
possessed before the Reformation,</p>
<p>In the present chapter attention will be confined to the
dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII., in England. The
suppression in that country was occasioned partly by peculiar,
local conditions, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>[pg
288]</span> and was more radical and permanent than the reforms in
other lands, yet it is entirely consistent with our general purpose
to restrict this narrative to English history. Penetrating beneath
the varying externalities attending the ruin of the monasteries in
Germany, Spain, France, Switzerland, Italy, and other countries, it
will be found that the underlying cause of the destruction of the
monasteries was that the monastic ideal conflicted with the spirit
of the modern era. A conspicuous and dramatic example of this
struggle between medievalism, as embodied in the monastic
institution, and modern political, social and religious ideals, is
to be found in the dissolution of the English monasteries. The
narrative of the suppression in England also conveys some idea of
the struggle that was carried on throughout Europe, with varying
intensity and results.</p>
<p>There is no more striking illustration of the power of the
personal equation in the interpretation of history than that
afforded by the conflicting opinions respecting the overthrow of
monasticism in England. Those who mourn the loss of the monasteries
cannot find words strong enough with which to condemn Henry VIII.,
whom they regard <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"></a>[pg
289]</span> as "unquestionably the most unconstitutional, the most
vicious king that ever wore the English crown." Forgetting the
inevitable cost of human freedom, and lightly passing over the
iniquities of the monastic system, they fondly dwell upon the
departed glory of the ancient abbeys. They recall with sadness the
days when the monks chanted their songs of praise in the chapels,
or reverently bent over their books of parchment, bound in purple
and gold, not that they might "winnow the treasures of knowledge,
but that they might elicit love, compunction and devotion." The
charming simplicity and loving service of the cloister life, in the
days of its unbroken vows, appeal to such defenders of the monks
with singular potency.</p>
<p>Truly, the fair-minded should attempt to appreciate the sorrow,
the indignation and the love of these friends of a ruined
institution. Passionless logic will never enable one to do justice
to the sentiments of those who cannot restrain their tears as they
stand uncovered before the majestic remains of a Melrose Abbey, or
properly to estimate the motives and methods of those who laid the
mighty monastic institution in the dust.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Character_of_Henry_VIII"></a>The Character of
Henry VIII</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Before considering the actual work of suppression, it may be
interesting to glance at the royal destroyer and his times. The
character of Henry VIII. is utterly inexplicable to many persons,
chiefly because they do not reflect that even the inconsistencies
of a great man may be understood when seen in the light of his
times. A masterly and comprehensive summary of the virtues and
vices of the Tudor monarch, who has been described as "the king,
the whole king, and nothing but the king," may be found in "A
History of Crime in England," by Luke Owen Pike. The distinguished
author shows that in his brutality, his love of letters, his
opposition to Luther, his vacillation in religious opinions, King
Henry reflects with remarkable fidelity the age in which he lived,
both in its contrasts and its inconsistencies. "It is only the
previous history of England which can explain all the
contradictions exhibited in his conduct,--which can explain how he
could be rapacious yet sometimes generous, the Defender of the
Faith yet <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>[pg
291]</span> under sentence of excommunication, a burner of heretics
yet a heretic himself, the pope's advocate yet the pope's greatest
enemy, a bloodthirsty tyrant yet the best friend to liberty of
thought in religion, an enthusiast yet a turncoat, a libertine and
yet all but a Puritan. He was sensual because his forefathers had
been sensual from time immemorial, rough in speech and action
because there had been but few men in Britain who had been
otherwise since the Romans abandoned the island. He was
superstitious and credulous because few were philosophical or
gifted with intellectual courage. Yet he had, what was possessed by
his contemporaries, a faint and intermittent thirst for knowledge,
of which he himself hardly knew the meaning." Henry was shrewd,
tenacious of purpose, capricious and versatile. In spite of his
unrestrained indulgences and his monstrous claims of power, which,
be it remembered, he was able to enforce, and notwithstanding any
other vices or faults that may be truthfully charged against him,
he was, on the whole, a popular king. Few monarchs have ever had to
bear such a strain as was placed upon his abilities and character.
Rare have been the periods that have <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page292"></a>[pg 292]</span> witnessed such confusion of
principles, social, political and religious. Those were the days
when liberty was at work, "but in a hundred fantastical and
repulsive shapes, confused and convulsive, multiform, deformed."
Blind violence and half-way reforms characterized the age because
the principles that were to govern modern times were not yet
formulated.</p>
<p>Judged apart from his times Henry appears as an arrogant, cruel
and fickle ruler, whose virtues fail to atone for his vices. But
still, with all his faults, he compares favorably with preceding
monarchs and even with his contemporaries. If he had possessed less
intelligence, courage and ambition, he would not now be so
conspicuous for his vices, but the history of human liberty and
free institutions, especially in England, would have been vastly
different. His praiseworthy traits were not sufficiently strong to
enable him to control his inherited passions, but they were too
regnant to permit him to submit without a struggle to the hierarchy
which had dominated his country so many centuries. Such was</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "the
majestic lord,<br>
That broke the bonds of Rome."</blockquote>

<h2><i><a name="Events_Preceding_the_Suppression"></a>Events
Preceding the Suppression</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Many causes and incidents contributed to the progress of the
reformation in England, and to the demolition of the monasteries.
Only a few of them can be given here, and they must be stated with
a brevity that conveys no adequate conception of their profound
significance.</p>
<p>Henry VIII. ascended the throne, in the year 1509, when eighteen
years of age. In 1517, Luther took his stand against Rome. Four
years later Henry wrote a treatise in defence of the Seven
Sacraments and in opposition to the German reformer. For this
princely service to the church the king received the title
"Defender of the Faith" from Pope Leo X.</p>
<p>About 1527 it became known that Henry was questioning the
validity of his marriage with Catharine of Aragon, whom he had
married when he was twelve years old. She was the widow of his
brother Arthur. The king professed conscientious scruples about his
marriage, but undoubtedly his desire for male offspring, and later,
his passion <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>[pg
294]</span> for Anne Boleyn, prompted him to seek release from his
queen. In 1529, Henry and Catharine stood before a papal tribunal,
presided over by Cardinal Wolsey, the king's prime minister, and
Cardinal Campeggio, from Rome, for the purpose of determining the
validity of the royal marriage. The trial was a farce. The enraged
king laid the blame upon Wolsey, and retired him from office. The
great cardinal was afterwards charged with treason, but died
broken-hearted, on his way to the Tower, November 29, 1530.</p>
<p>The breach between Henry and Rome, complicated by numerous
international intrigues, widened rapidly. Henry began to assume an
attitude of bold defiance toward the pope, which aroused the
animosity of the Catholic princes of Europe.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the desire of a large body of the English people
to remain faithful to Rome, the dangers which menaced their country
from abroad and the ecclesiastical abuses at home, which had been a
fruitful cause for complaint for many years, tended to lessen the
ancient horror of heresy and schism, and inclined them to support
their king. Another factor that assisted in preparing the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span> people
for the destruction of the monasteries was Lollardism. As an
organized sect, the Lollards had ceased to exist, but the spirit
and the doctrines of Wyclif did not die. A real and a vital
connection existed between the Lollards of the fourteenth, and the
reformers of the sixteenth, centuries. In Henry's time, many
Englishmen held practically the same views of Rome and of the monks
that had been taught by Wyclif[<a href="#NOTE_I">I</a>].</p>
<p>A considerable number of Henry's subjects, however, while
ostensibly loyal to him, were inwardly full of hot rebellion. The
king was surrounded with perils. The princes of the Continent were
eagerly awaiting the bull for his excommunication. Henry's throne
and his kingdom might at any moment be given over by the pope to
invasion by the continental sovereigns.</p>
<p>Reginald Pole, afterwards cardinal, a cousin of the king, and a
strong Catholic, stood ready to betray the interests of his country
to Rome. Writing to the king, he said: "Man is against you; God is
against you; the universe is against you; what can you look for but
destruction?" "Dream not, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page296"></a>[pg 296]</span> Caesar," he encouragingly declared to
Emperor Charles V., "that all generous hearts are quenched in
England; that faith and piety are dead. In you is their trust, in
your noble nature, and in your zeal for God--they hold their land
till you shall come." Thus, on the testimony of a Roman Catholic,
there were traitors in England waiting only for the call of Charles
V., "To arms!" Pole was in full sympathy with all the factions
opposed to the king, and stood ready to aid them in their
resistance. He publicly denounced the king in several continental
countries.</p>
<p>The monks were especially enraged against Henry. They did all
they could to inflame the people by preaching against him and the
reformers. Friar Peyto, preaching before the king, had the
assurance to say to him: "Many lying prophets have deceived you,
but I, as a true Micah, warn you that the dogs will lick your blood
as they did Ahab's." While the courage of this friar is
unquestioned, his defiant attitude illustrates the position
occupied by the monks toward those who favored separation from
Rome. The whole country was at white heat. The friends of Rome
looked upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>[pg
297]</span> Henry as an incarnate fiend, a servant of the devil and
an enemy of all religion. Many of them opposed him with the purest
and best motives, believing that the king was really undermining
the church of God and throwing society into chaos.</p>
<p>In 1531, the English clergy were coerced into declaring that
Henry was "the protector and the supreme head of the church and of
the clergy of England," which absurd claim was slightly modified by
the words, "in so far as is permitted by the law of Christ."
Chapuys, in one of his despatches informing Charles V. of this
action of convocation, said that it practically declared Henry the
Pope of England. "It is true," he wrote, "that the clergy have
added to the declaration that they did so only so far as permitted
by the law of God. But that is all the same, as far as the king is
concerned, as if they had made no reservation, for no one will now
be so bold as to contest with his lord the importance of the
reservation." Later on, Chapuys says that the king told the pope's
nuncio that "if the pope would not show him more consideration, he
would show the world that the pope had no greater authority than
Moses, and that every claim <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page298"></a>[pg 298]</span> not grounded on Scripture was mere
usurpation; that the great concourse of people present had come
solely and exclusively to request him to bastinado the clergy, who
were hated by both nobles and the people." ("Spanish Despatches,"
number 460.)</p>
<p>Parliament, in 1534, conferred on Henry the title "Supreme Head
of the Church of England," and empowered him "to visit, and
repress, redress, reform, order, correct, restrain, or amend all
errors, heresies, abuses, offences, contempts, and enormities,
which fell under any spiritual authority or jurisdiction." The "Act
of Succession" was also passed by Parliament, cutting off Princess
Mary and requiring all subjects to take an oath of allegiance to
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>It was now an act of treason to deny the king's supremacy. All
persons suspected of disloyalty were required to sign an oath of
allegiance to Henry, and to Elizabeth as his successor, and to
acknowledge the supremacy of the king in church and state. This
resulted in the death of some prominent men in the realm, among
them Sir Thomas More. In the preamble of the oath prescribed by
law, the legality of the king's marriage <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span> with Anne was
asserted, thus implying that his former marriage with Catharine was
unlawful. More was willing to declare his allegiance to the infant
Elizabeth, as the king's successor, but his conscience would not
permit him to affirm that Catharine's marriage was unlawful.</p>
<p>The life of the brilliant and lovable More is another
illustration of the mental confusions and inconsistencies of that
age. As an apostle of culture he favored the new learning, and yet
he viewed the gathering momentum of reformatory principles with
alarm, and cast in his lot with the ultra-conservatives. Four years
of his young manhood were spent in a monastery. He devoted his
splendid talents to a criticism of English society, and recommended
freedom of conscience, yet he became an ardent foe of reform and
even a persecutor of heretics, of whom he said: "I do so detest
that class of men that, unless they repent, I am the worst enemy
they have." When a man, whom even Protestant historians hasten to
pronounce "the glory of his age," so magnificent were his talents
and so blameless his character, was tainted with superstition, and
sanctioned the persecution of liberal thinkers, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span> is it remarkable
that inferior intellects should have been swayed by the brutality
and tyranny of the times?</p>
<p>The unparalleled claims of Henry and his attitude toward the
pope made the breach between England and Rome complete, but many
years of painful internal strife and bloodshed were to elapse
before the whole nation submitted to the new order of things, and
before that subjective freedom from fear and superstition without
which formal freedom has little value, was secured.</p>
<p>The breach with Rome was essential to the attainment of that
religious and political freedom that England now enjoys. But the
first step toward making that separation an accomplished fact,
acquiesced in by the people as a whole, was to break the power of
the monastic orders. It may possibly be true that the same ends
would have been eventually attained by trusting to the slower
processes of social evolution, but the history of the Latin nations
of Europe would seem to prove the contrary. As the facts stand it
would appear that peace and progress were impossible with thousands
of monks sowing seeds of discord, and employing every measure, fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span> or
foul, to win the country back to Rome. Gairdner and others argue
that Henry was far too powerful a king to have been successfully
resisted by the pope, unless the pope was backed by a union of the
Christian princes, which was then impracticable. That fact may make
the execution of More, Fisher and the Charterhouse monks
inexcusable, but it by no means proves that Henry would have been
strong enough to maintain his position if the monasteries had been
permitted to exist as centers of organized opposition to his will.
Many of the monks, when pressed by the king's agents, took the oath
of allegiance. Threats, bribes and violence were used to overcome
the opposition of the unwilling.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Monks_and_the_Oath_of_Supremacy"></a>The Monks
and the Oath of Supremacy</i></h2>
<br>
<p>It is quite evident that the king's purpose to destroy the whole
monastic institution was partly the result of the determined
resistance which the monks offered to his authority. The contest
between the king and the monks was exceedingly fierce and bloody.
Many good men lost their lives and many innocent persons suffered
grievously. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>[pg
302]</span> Perhaps the most pathetic incident in the sanguinary
struggle between the king and the monks was the tragic fall of the
Charterhouse of London. The facts are given at length by Froude, in
his "History of England," who bases his account on the narrative of
Maurice Channey, one of the monks who escaped death by yielding to
the king. The unhappy monk confesses that he was a Judas among the
apostles, and in a touching account of the ruin that came upon his
monastic retreat he praises the boldness and fidelity of his
companions, who preferred death to what seemed to them
dishonor.</p>
<p>The pages of Channey are filled with the most improbable stories
of miracles, but his charming picture of the cloister life of the
Carthusians is doubtless true to reality. The Carthusian fathers
were the best fruit of monasticism in England. To a higher degree
than any of the other monastic orders they maintained a good
discipline and preserved the spirit of their founders. "A thousand
years of the world's history had rolled by," says Froude, "and
these lonely islands of prayer had remained still anchored in the
stream; the strands of the ropes which held them, wearing now to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span> thread,
and very near their last parting, but still unbroken." In view of
the undisputed purity and fearlessness of these noble monks, a
recital of their woes will place the case for the monastic
institution in the most favorable light.</p>
<p>Channey says the year 1533 was ushered in with signs,--the end
of the world was nigh. Yes, the monk's world was drawing to a
close; the moon, for him, was turning into blood, and the stars
falling from heaven.</p>
<p>More and Fisher were in the Tower. The former's splendid talents
and noble character still swayed the people. It was no time for
trifling; the Carthusian fathers must take the oath of allegiance
or perish. So one morning the royal commissioners appeared before
the monastery door of the Charterhouse to demand submission. Prior
Houghton answered them: "I know nothing of the matter mentioned; I
am unacquainted with the world without; my office is to minister to
God, and to save poor souls from Satan." He was committed to the
Tower for one month. Then Dr. Bonner persuaded the prior to sign
with "certain reservations." He was released and went back to his
cloister-cell to weep. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page304"></a>[pg 304]</span> Calling his monks together he said he
was sorry; it looked like deceit, but he desired to save his
brethren and their order. The commissioners returned; the monks
were under suspicion; the reservations were disliked, and they must
sign without conditions. In great consternation the prior assembled
the monks. All present cried out: "Let us die together in our
integrity, and heaven and earth shall witness for us how unjustly
we are cut off." Prior Houghton conceived a generous idea. "If it
depends on me alone; if my oath will suffice for the house, I will
throw myself on the mercy of God; I will make myself anathema, and
to preserve you from these dangers, I will consent to the king's
will." Thus did the noble old man consent to go into heaven with a
lie on his conscience, hoping to escape by the mercy of God,
because he sought to save the lives of his brethren. But all this
was of no avail; Cromwell had determined that this monastery must
fall, and fall it did. The monks prepared for their end calmly and
nobly; beginning with the oldest brother, they knelt before each
other and begged forgiveness for all unkindness and offence. "Not
less deserving," says Froude, "the everlasting remembrances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span> of
mankind, than those three hundred, who, in the summer morning, sate
combing their golden hair in the passes of Thermopyl&aelig;." But
rebellion was blazing in Ireland, and the enemies of the king were
praying and plotting for his ruin. These monks, with More and
Fisher, were an inspiration to the enemies of liberty and the
kingdom. Catholic Europe crouched like a tiger ready to spring on
her prostrate foe. It is sad, but these recluses, praying for the
pope, instilling a love for the papacy in the confessional, these
honest and conscientious but dangerous men must be shorn of their
power to encourage rebels. There was a farce of a trial. Houghton
was brought to the scaffold and died protesting his innocence. His
arm was cut off and hung over the archway of the Charterhouse, as
other arms and heads were hideously hanging over many a monastic
gate in Merry England. Nine of the monks died of prison fever, and
others were banished. The king's court went into mourning, and
Henry knotted his beard and henceforth would be no more
shaven--eloquent evidence to the world that whatever motive
dominated the king's heart, these bloody deeds were unpleasantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span>
disturbing. Certainly such a spectacle as that of a monk's arm
nailed to a monastery was never seen by Englishmen before.</p>
<p>The Charterhouse fell, let it be carefully noted, because the
monks could not and would not acknowledge the king's supremacy, and
not because the monks were immoral. Some spies in Cromwell's
service offered to, bring in evidence against six of these monks of
"laziness and immorality." Cromwell indignantly refused the
proposal, saying, "He would not hear the accusation; that it was
false, wilfully so."</p>
<p>The news of these proceedings, and of the beheading of More and
Fisher, awakened the most violent rage throughout Catholic Europe.
Henry was denounced as the Nero of his times. Paul III. immediately
excommunicated the king, dissolved all leagues between Henry and
the Catholic princes, and gave his kingdom to any invader. All
Catholic subjects were ordered to take up arms against him.
Although these censures were passed, the pope decided to defer
their publication, hoping for a peaceful settlement. But Henry
knew, and the Catholic princes of Europe <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span> knew, that the blow
might fall at any time. He had to make up his mind to go further or
to yield unconditionally to the pope. The world soon discovered the
temper of the enraged and stubborn monarch. He might vacillate on
speculative questions, but there were no tokens of feeble hesitancy
in his dealings with Rome. The hour of doom for the monasteries had
struck.</p>
<p>Having thus glanced at the character of Henry VIII., the prime
mover in the attack upon the monasteries, and having surveyed some
of the events leading up to their fall, we are now prepared to
consider the actual work of suppression, which will be described
under the following heads: First, The royal commissioners and their
methods of investigation; Second, The commissioners' report on the
condition of affairs; Third, The action of Parliament; Fourth, The
effect of the suppression upon the people; and Fifth, The use Henry
made of the monastic possessions. These matters having been set
forth, it will then be in order to inquire into the justification,
real or alleged, of the suppression.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Royal_Commissioners"></a>The Royal
Commissioners and Their Methods of Investigation</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The fall of Sir Thomas More left Thomas Cromwell the chief power
under the king, and for seven years he devoted his great
administrative abilities to making his royal patron absolute ruler
in church and state.</p>
<p>Cromwell, Earl of Essex, was of lowly origin, but his energy and
shrewdness, together with the experience acquired by extensive
travels, commanded the attention of Cardinal Wolsey, who took him
into his service. He was successively merchant, scrivener,
money-lender, lawyer, member of parliament, master of jewels,
chancellor, master of rolls, secretary of state, vicar-general in
ecclesiastical affairs, lord privy seal, dean of Wells and high
chamberlain.</p>
<p>Close intimacy with Wolsey enabled Cromwell to grasp the full
significance of Henry's ambition, and his desire to please his
royal master, coupled with his own love of power, prompted him to
throw himself with characteristic energy into the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span> work of
centralizing all authority in the hands of the king and of his
prime minister. In secular affairs, this had already been
accomplished. The task before him was to subdue the church to the
throne, to execute which he became the protector of Protestantism
and the foe of Rome. Green says: "He had an absolute faith in the
end he was pursuing, and he simply hews his way to it, as a woodman
hews his way through the forest, axe in hand." Froude says: "To him
ever belonged the rare privilege of genius to see what other men
could not see, and therefore he was condemned to rule a generation
which hated him, to do the will of God and to perish in his
success. He pursued an object, the excellence of which, as his mind
saw it, transcended all other considerations, the freedom of
England and the destruction of idolatry, and those who, from any
motive, noble or base, pious or impious, crossed his path, he
crushed and passed on over their bodies."</p>
<p>There seems to be a general agreement that Cromwell was not a
Protestant. His struggle against the temporal power of the pope
fostered <span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>[pg
310]</span> the reformatory movement, but that did not make
Cromwell a Protestant any more than it did his master, Henry VIII.
Foxe describes Cromwell "as a valiant soldier and captain of
Christ," but Maitland retorts "that Foxe forgot, if he ever knew,
who was the father of lies."</p>
<p>Without doubt Cromwell ruled with an iron hand. He was guilty of
accepting bribes, and, as some maintain, "was the great patron of
ribaldry, and the protector of the low jester and the filthy." But,
sadly enough, that is no serious charge against one in his times.
It is said that Henry used to say, when a knave was dealt to him in
a game of cards, "Ah, I have a Cromwell!" Francis Aidan Gasquet, a
Benedictine monk, in his valuable work on "Henry VIII. and the
English Monasteries," says of Cromwell: "No single minister in
England ever exercised such extensive authority, none ever rose so
rapidly, and no one has ever left behind him a name covered with
greater infamy and disgrace."</p>
<p>In 1535, Henry, as supreme head of the church, appointed
Cromwell as his "Vicegerent, Vicar-General and Principal Commissary
in causes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>[pg
311]</span> ecclesiastical." His immediate duty was to enforce
recognition of the king's supremacy. The monks and the clergy were
now to be coerced into submission. A royal commission, consisting
of Legh, Layton, Ap Rice, London and various subordinates, was
appointed to visit the monasteries and to report on their
condition.</p>
<p>Henry Griffin says in his chronicle: "I was well acquainted with
all the commissioners; indeed I knew them well; they were very
smart men, who understood the value of money, for they had tasted
of adversity. I think the priests were the worst of the whole
party, although they had a good reputation at the time, but they
were wicked, deceitful men. I am sorry to speak thus of my own
order, but I speak God's truth." "It is a dreadful undertaking,"
said Lord Clinton. "Ah! but I have great faith in the tact and
judgment of the men I am about to select," retorted Cromwell.</p>
<p>Dr. John London was a base tool of Cromwell, and a miserable
exponent of the reform movement. He joined Gardiner in burning
heretics, was convicted of adultery at Oxford, was pilloried for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span> perjury
and died in jail. The other royal agents were also questionable
characters. Dean Layton wrote the most disgusting letters to
Cromwell. Once he informed his patron that he prayed regularly for
him, prefacing this information with the remark, "I will now tell
you something to make you laugh."</p>
<p>Father Gasquet sums up his view of the commissioners in the
words of Edmund Burke: "It is not with much credulity that I listen
to any when they speak ill of those whom they are going to plunder.
I rather suspect that vices are feigned, or exaggerated, when
profit is looked for in the punishment--an enemy is a bad witness;
a robber worse." Burke indignantly declares: "The inquiry into the
moral character of the religious houses was a mere pretext, a
complete delusion, an insidious and predetermined foray of
wholesale and heartless plunder."</p>
<p>Such are the protests from the defenders of the monasteries even
before a hearing is granted. "What," say they, "believe such
perjurers, adulterers and gamblers; men forsworn to bring in a bad
report; men who were selected because they <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span> were worthless
characters who could be relied on to return false charges against
an institution loved by the people?"</p>
<p>The commissioners began their work at Oxford, in September,
1535. The work was vigorously pushed. On reaching the door of a
monastery, they demanded admittance; if it was not granted, they
entered by breaking down the gate with an axe. They then summoned
the monks before them, and plied them with questions. An inventory
was taken of everything; nothing escaped their searching eyes. When
the king decided to suppress the lesser monasteries, and ordered a
new visitation of the larger ones, they seized and sold all they
could lay their hands on; "stained glass, ironwork, bells,
altar-cloths, candles, books, beads, images, capes, brewing-tubs,
brass bolts, spits for cooking, kitchen utensils, plates, basins,
all were turned into money." Many valuable books were destroyed;
jewels and gold and silver clasps were torn from old volumes, and
the paper sold as waste; parchment manuscripts were used to scour
tubs and grease boots. Out of the wreck about a hundred and thirty
thousand manuscripts <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page314"></a>[pg 314]</span> have been saved. It must be admitted
that the commissioners were not delicate in their labors; that they
insulted many nuns, robbed the monks, violated the laws of decency
and humanity, and needlessly excited the rage of the people and
outraged the religious sentiments of the Catholics. They even used
sacred altar-cloths for blankets on their horses, and rode across
the country decorated in priestly and monkish garments. There seems
to be some ground for the statement that Henry was ignorant, or at
least not fully informed, of their unwarranted violence and gross
sacrilege. The abbey of Glastonbury was one of the oldest and
finest cloisters in England. It was a majestic pile of buildings in
the midst of gardens and groves covering sixty acres; its aisles
were vocal with the chanting of monks, who marched in gorgeous
processions among the tall, gray pillars. The exterior of the
buildings was profusely decorated with sculpture; monarchs, temple
knights, mitered abbots, martyrs and apostles stood for centuries
in their niches of stone while princes came and passed away, while
kingdoms rose and fell. The nobles and bishops of the realm were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span> laid to
rest beneath the altars around which many generations of monks had
assembled to praise and to pray. The royal commissioners one day
appeared before the walls. The abbot, Richard Whiting, who was then
eighty-four years of age, was at Sharphorn, another residence of
the community. He was brought back and questioned. At night when he
was in bed, they searched his study for letters and books, and they
claimed to have found a manuscript of Whiting's arguments against
the divorce of the king and Queen Catharine; it had never been
published; they did not know whether the venerable abbot had such
intent or not. Stephen declares the spies themselves brought the
book into the library. However, the abbot was chained to a cart and
taken to London. The abbey had immense wealth; every Wednesday and
Friday it fed and lodged three hundred boys; it was esteemed very
highly in the neighborhood and received large donations from the
knights in the vicinity. The abbot was accused of treason for
concealing the sacred vessels; he was old, deaf, and sick, but was
allowed no counsel. He asked permission to <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>[pg 316]</span> take leave of his
monks, and many little orphans; Russell and Layton only laughed.
The people heard of his captivity and determined "to deliver or
avenge" their favorite, but Russell hanged half a dozen of them and
declared that "law, order and loyalty were vindicated." Whiting's
body was quartered, and the pieces sent to Wells, Bath, Chester and
Bridgewater, while his head, adorned with his gray hairs clotted by
blood, was hung over the abbey gate.</p>

<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Report_of_the_Commissioners"></a>The Report of
the Commissioners</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The original report of the commissioners does not exist. Burnet
declares that he saw an extract from it, concerning one hundred and
forty-four houses, which contained the most revolting revelations.
Many of the commissioners' letters and various documents touching
the suppression have been collected and published by the Camden
Society. Waiving, for the present, the inquiry into the truth of
the report, it was in substance as follows:</p>
<p>The commissioners reported about one-third of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span> the houses to be
fairly well conducted, some of them models of excellent management
and pure living; but the other two-thirds were charged with
looseness beyond description. The number of inmates in some
cloisters was kept below the required number, that there might be
more money to divide among the monks. The number of servants
sometimes exceeded that of the monks. Abbots bought and sold land
in a fraudulent manner; gifts for hospitality were misapplied;
licentiousness, gaming and drinking prevailed extensively. Crime
and absolution for gold went hand in hand. One friar was said to
have been the proud father of an illegitimate family of children,
but he had in his possession a forged license from the pope, who
permitted his wandering, "considering his frailty." Froude, in
commenting upon the report, says: "If I were to tell the truth, I
should have first to warn all modest eyes to close the book and
read no farther."</p>
<p>All sorts of pious frauds were revealed. At Hales the monks
claimed to have the blood of Christ brought from Jerusalem, and not
visible to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>[pg
318]</span> anyone in mortal sin until he had performed good works,
or, in other words, paid enough for his absolution. Two monks took
the blood of a duck, which they renewed every week; this they put
into a phial, one side of which consisted of a thin, transparent
crystal; the other thick and opaque; the dark side was shown until
the sinner's gold was exhausted, when, presto! change, the blood
appeared by turning the other side of the phial. Innumerable
toe-parings, bones, pieces of skin, three heads of St. Ursula, and
other anatomical relics of departed saints, were said to cure every
disease known to man. They had relics that could drive away
plagues, give rain, hinder weeds, and in fact, render the natural
world the plaything of decaying bones and shreds of dried skin. The
monks of Reading had an angel with one wing, who had preserved the
spear with which our Lord was pierced. Abbots were found to have
concubines in or near the monasteries; midnight revels and drunken
feasts were pleasant pastimes for monks weary with prayers and
fasting. While it would be unjust to argue that the existence of
"pious frauds" affords a justification for the suppression of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span>
monasteries, it must be remembered that they constituted one
element in that condition of ecclesiastical life that was becoming
repugnant to the English people. For several generations there had
been a marked growth in the hostility toward various forms of
superstition. True, neither Henry nor Cromwell can be accredited
with the lofty intention of exterminating superstition, but the
attitude of many people toward "pious frauds" helped to reconcile
them to the destruction of the monasteries.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Action_of_Parliament"></a>The Action of
Parliament</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The report of the commissioners was laid before Parliament in
1536. As it declared that the smaller monasteries were more corrupt
than the larger ones, Parliament ordered the suppression of all
those houses whose revenues were less than two hundred pounds per
annum. By this act, three hundred and seventy-six houses were
suppressed, whose aggregate revenue was thirty-two thousand pounds
yearly. Movable property valued at about one hundred thousand
pounds was also handed over to the "Court of Augmentations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span> of the
King's Revenue," which was established to take care of the estates,
revenues and other possessions of the monasteries. It is claimed
that ten thousand monks and nuns were turned out into the world, to
find bed and board as best they could. In 1538, two years later,
the greater monasteries met a similar fate, which was no doubt
hastened by the rebellions that followed the abolition of the
smaller houses. Many of the abbots and monks were suspected of
aiding in the rebellion against the king's authority by inciting
the people to take up arms against him. Apprehending the coming
doom, many abbots resigned; others were overcome by threats and
yielded without a struggle. In many instances such monks received
pensions varying from fifty-three shillings and four pence to four
pounds a year. The investigations were constantly carried on, and
all the foul stories that could be gathered were given to the
people, to secure their approval of the king's action. With
remorseless zeal the king and his commissioners, supported by
various acts of parliament, persevered in their work of
destruction, until even the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page321"></a>[pg 321]</span> monastic hospitals, chantries, free
chapels and collegiate churches, fell into the king's hands. By the
year 1545, the ruin was complete. The monastic institution of
England was no more. The total number of monasteries suppressed is
variously estimated, but the following figures are approximately
correct: monasteries, 616; colleges, 90; free chapels, 2,374; and
hospitals, 110. The annual income was about one hundred and fifty
thousand pounds, which was a smaller sum than was then believed to
be in the control of the monks. Nearly fifty thousand persons were
driven from the houses, to foment the discontent and to arouse the
pity of the people. Such, in brief, was the extent of the
suppression, but a little reflection will show that these
statements of cold facts convey no conception of the confusion and
sorrow that must have accompanied this terrific and wholesale
assault upon an institution that had been accumulating its
possessions for eight hundred years. At this distance from those
tragic events, it is impossible to realize the dismay of those who
stood aghast at this ruthless destruction of such venerable
establishments.</p>

<h2><i><a name=
"The_Effect_of_the_Suppression_Upon_the_People"></a>The Effect of
the Suppression Upon the People</i></h2>
<br>
<p>For months the country had seen what was coming; letters from
abbots and priors poured in upon the king and parliament, begging
them to spare the ancient strongholds of religion. The churchmen
argued: "If he plunders the monasteries, will not his next step be
to plunder the churches?" They recalled what Sir Thomas More had
said of their sovereign: "It is true, his majesty is very gracious
with me, but if only my head would give him another castle in
France, it would not be long before it disappeared." Sympathy for
the monks, an inborn conservatism, a natural love for ancient
institutions, a religious dread of trampling upon that which was
held sacred by the church, a secret antipathy to reform, all these
and other forces were against the suppression. But the report of
the visitors was appalling, and the fear of the king's displeasure
was widespread; so the bill was passed amid mingled feelings of
joy, sympathy, hatred, fear, anxiety and uncertainty. The bishops
were sullen; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>[pg
323]</span> Latimer was disappointed, for he wanted the church to
have the proceeds.</p>
<p>Outside of Parliament there was much discontent among the nobles
and gentry of Roman tendencies. Even the indifferent felt bitter
against the king, because it seemed unjust that the monks, who had
been sheltered, honored and enriched by the people, should be so
rudely and so suddenly turned out of their possessions. A
dangerously large portion of the people felt themselves insulted
and outraged. At first, however, there were few who dared to voice
their protests. "As the royal policy disclosed itself," says Green,
"as the monarchy trampled under foot the tradition and reverence of
ages gone by, as its figure rose, bare and terrible, out of the
wreck of old institutions, England simply held her breath. It is
only through the stray depositions of royal spies that we catch a
glimpse of the wrath and hate which lay seething under the silence
of the people." That silence was a silence of terror. To use the
figure by which Erasmus describes the time, men felt "as if a
scorpion lay sleeping under every stone." They stopped writing,
gossiping, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>[pg
324]</span> going to confession, and sending presents for the most
thoughtless word or deed might be tortured into treason against the
king by the command of Cromwell.</p>
<p>The rebellion which followed the first attack upon the
monasteries was not caused wholly by religious sentiments. The
nobles regarded Cromwell as a base-born usurper and yearned for his
fall, while the clergy felt outraged by his monstrous claims of
authority in ecclesiastical affairs. In a sense the conflict that
ensued was but a continuation of the long-standing struggle between
the king, the barons, and the clergy for the supreme power. From
the reign of Edward I., the people had commenced to assert their
rights and the struggle had become a four-sided one.</p>
<p>These four factions were constantly shifting their allegiance,
according to the varying conditions, and guided by their changing
interests. At this time, the clergy, the nobles and the people in
northern England, particularly, combined against the king, although
the alliance was not formidable enough to overcome the forces
supporting the king.</p>
<p>The secular clergy felt that they were disgraced <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span> and coerced into
submission. They felt their revenues, their honors, their powers,
their glory, slipping away from them; they joined their mutterings
and discontent with that of the monks, and then the fires of the
rebellion blazed forth in the north, where the monasteries were
more popular than in any other part of England.</p>
<p>The first outbreak occurred in Lincolnshire, in the autumn of
1536. It was easily and quickly suppressed. But another uprising in
Yorkshire, in northern England, followed immediately, and for a
time threatened serious consequences. Some of the best families in
that part of the country joined the revolt, although it is
noteworthy that these same families were afterwards Protestant and
Puritan; the rebel army numbered about forty thousand men, well
equipped for service. Many prominent abbots and sixteen hundred
monks were in the ranks. The masses were bound by oath "to stand
together for the love which they bore to Almighty God, His faith,
the Holy Church, and the maintenance thereof; to the preservation
of the king's person and his issue; to the purifying of the
nobility, and to expel <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page326"></a>[pg 326]</span> all villein blood and evil
counsellors from the king's presence; not from any private profit,
nor to do his pleasure to any private person, nor to slay or murder
through envy, but for the restitution of the Church, and the
suppression of heretics and their opinions." It is clear, from the
language of the oath, that the rebels aimed their blows at
Cromwell. The secular clergy hated him because he had shorn them of
their power; the monks hated him because he had turned them out of
their cloisters, and clergy and people loathed him as a maintainer
of heresy, a low-born foe of the Church. The insurgents carried
banners on which was printed a crucifix, a chalice and host, and
the five wounds, hence they called themselves "Pilgrims of Grace."
The revolt was headed by Robert Aske, a barrister.</p>
<p>Cromwell acted most cautiously; he selected the strongest men to
take the field. Richard Cromwell said of one of them, Sir John
Russell, "for my lord admiral, he is so earnest in the matter that
I dare say he could eat the Pilgrims without salt." The Duke of
Norfolk was entrusted with the command of the king's forces.</p>
<p>Henry preferred negotiation to battle, in accepting <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span> which the rebels
were doomed. To wait was to fail. Their demands reduced to paper
were: 1. The religious houses should be restored. 2. England should
be reunited with Rome. 3. The first fruits and tenths should not be
paid to the crown. 4. Heretics, meaning Cranmer, Latimer and
others, should cease to be bishops. 5. Catharine's daughter Mary
should be restored as heiress to the crown. These and other
demands, the granting of which would have meant the death of the
Reformation, were firmly refused by the king, who marveled that
ignorant churls, "brutes and inexpert folk" should talk of
theological and political subjects to him and to his council.</p>
<p>After several ineffectual attempts to meet the royal army in
battle, partly due to storms and lack of subsistence, the rebels
were induced to disperse and a general amnesty was declared. But
new insurrections broke out in various quarters, and the enraged
king determined to stamp out the smoldering fires of sedition.
About seventy-five persons were hanged, and many prominent men were
imprisoned and afterwards executed. This effectually suppressed the
rebellion.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span>
<p>The revolt showed the strength of the opponents to the king's
will, but it also proved conclusively that the monarchy was the
strongest power in the realm; that the star of ecclesiastical
domination had set forever in England; that henceforth English
kings and not Italian popes were to govern the English people.
True, the king was carrying things with a high hand, but one reform
at a time; the yoke of papal power must first be lifted, even if at
the same time the king becomes despotic in the exercise of his
increased power. Once free from Rome, constitutional rights may be
asserted and the power of an absolute monarchy judiciously
restricted.</p>
<p>Following the Pilgrimage of Grace came the complete overthrow of
the monastic system by the dissolution of the larger
monasteries.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Henry's_Disposal_of_Monastic_Revenues"></a>Henry's
Disposal of Monastic Revenues</i></h2>
<br>
<p>What use did Henry make of the revenues that fell into his
hands? As soon as the vast estates of the monks were under the
king's control, he was besieged by nobles, "praying for an estate."
They <span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>[pg 329]</span>
kneeled before him and specified what lands they wanted. They
bribed Cromwell, who sold many of the estates at the rate of a
twenty years' purchase, and in some instances presented valuable
possessions to the king's followers. Many families, powerful in
England at the present time, date the beginning of their wealth and
position to the day when their ancestors received their share of
the king's plunder.</p>
<p>The following interesting passage from Sir Edward Coke's
Institutes, shows that Henry sought to quiet the fears of the
people by making the most captivating promises concerning the
decrease of taxes, and other magnificent schemes for the general
welfare: "On the king's behalf, the members of both houses were
informed in Parliament that no king or kingdom was safe but where
the king had three abilities: 1. To live of his own and able to
defend his kingdom upon any sudden invasion or insurrection. 2. To
aid his confederates, otherwise they would never assist him. 3. To
reward his well-deserving servants. Now the project was, that if
Parliament would give unto him all the abbeys, priories, friaries,
nunneries, and other <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page330"></a>[pg 330]</span> monasteries, that forever in time
then to come he would take order that the same should not be
converted to private uses, but first, that his exchequer, for the
purpose aforesaid, should be enriched; secondly, the kingdom should
be strengthened by a continual maintenance of forty thousand
well-trained soldiers; thirdly, for the benefit and ease of the
subject, who never afterwards (as was projected), in any time to
come, should be charged with subsidies, fifteenths, loans or other
common aids; fourthly, lest the honor of the realm should receive
any diminution of honor by the dissolution of the said monasteries,
there being twenty-nine lords of Parliament of the abbots and
priors, ... that the king would create a number of nobles."</p>
<p>The king was granted the revenues of the monasteries. About half
the money was expended in coast defences and a new navy; and much
of it was lavished upon his courtiers. With the exception of small
pensions to the monks and the establishment of a few benefices,
very little of the splendid revenue was ever devoted to religious
or educational purposes. Small sums were set apart for Cambridge,
Oxford and new grammar schools. Not-withstanding <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span> the pensions, there
was much suffering; it is said many of the outcast monks and nuns
starved and froze to death by the roadside. Latimer and others
wanted the king to employ the revenues for religious purposes, but
Henry evidently thought the church had enough and refused. He did,
however, intend to allot eighteen thousand pounds a year for
eighteen new bishoprics, but once the gold was in his possession,
his pious intentions suffered a decline, and he established only
six, with inferior endowments, five of which exist to-day.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="Was_the_Suppression_Justifiable?"></a>Was the
Suppression Justifiable?</i></h2>
<br>
<p>It is quite common to restrict this inquiry to a consideration
of the report made by the commissioners against the monks, and to
the methods employed by them in their investigations. The
implication is that if the accusations against the monasteries can
be discredited, or if it can be shown that the motives of the
destroyers were selfish and their methods cruel, then it follows
that the overthrow of the monasteries was a most iniquitous and
unwarrantable proceeding. Reflection will show <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>[pg 332]</span> that the question
cannot be so restricted. It may be found that the monastic
institution should have been destroyed, even though the charges
against the monks were grossly exaggerated, the motives of the king
unworthy, and the means he employed despicable.</p>
<p>At the outset a few facts deserve mention. It is usual for
Protestants to recall with pride the glorious heroism of Protestant
martyrs, but it should be remembered that Roman Catholicism also
has had its martyrs. Protestant powers have not been free from
tyranny and bloodshed. That noble spirit of self-sacrifice which
has glorified many a character in history is not to be despised in
one who dies for what we may pronounce to be false.</p>
<p>It must also be granted that the action of the king was not
dictated by a pure passion for religious reform. Indeed it is a
fair question whether Henry may be claimed by the Protestants at
all. Aside from his rejection of the pope's authority, he was
thoroughly Catholic in conviction and in practice. His impatience
with the pope's position respecting his divorce, his need of money,
his love of power, and many other personal considerations
determined his attitude toward the papacy.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>[pg 333]</span>
<p>It should also be freely conceded that the royal commissioners
were far from exemplary characters, and that they were often
insolent and cruel in the prosecution of their work.</p>
<p>"Our posterity," says John Bale, "may well curse this wicked
fact of our age; this unreasonable spoil of England's most noble
antiquities." "On the whole," says Blunt, "it may be said that we
must ever look back on that destruction as a series of transactions
in which the sorrow, the waste, the impiety that were wrought, were
enough to make the angels weep. It may be true that the monastic
system had worn itself out for practical good; or at least, that it
was unfitted for those coming ages which were to be so different
from the ages that were past. But slaughter, desecration and wanton
destruction, were no remedies for its sins, or its failings; nor
was covetous rapacity the spirit of reformation."</p>
<p>Hume observes that "during times of faction, especially of a
religious kind, no equity is to be expected from adversaries; and
as it was known that the king's intention in this visitation was to
find a pretext for abolishing the monasteries, we <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span> may naturally
conclude that the reports of the commissioners are very little to
be relied upon." Hallam declares that "it is impossible to feel too
much indignation at the spirit in which the proceedings were
conducted."</p>
<p>But these and other just and honorable concessions in the
interests of truth, which are to be found on the pages of eminent
Protestant historians, are made to prove too much. It must be said
that writers favorable to monasticism take an unfair advantage of
these admissions, which simply testify to a spirit of candor and a
love of truth, but do not contain the final conclusions of these
historians. Employing these witnesses to confirm their opinions,
the defenders of monasticism proceed with fervid, glowing rhetoric,
breathing devotion and love on every page, to paint the sorrows and
ruin of the Carthusian Fathers, and the abbots of Glastonbury and
Reading. They ask, "Is this your boasted freedom, to slay these men
in cold blood, not for immorality, but because they honestly did
not acknowledge what no Protestant of to-day admits, viz.: that
King Henry was the Supreme Head of the Church?" Having pointed out
the exaggerations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>[pg
335]</span> in the charges against the monks and having made us
weep for the aged fathers of the Charterhouse, they skillfully lead
the unwary to the conclusion that the suppression should never have
taken place. This conclusion is illogical. The case is still
open.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if one cared to indulge in historical
reminiscences, he might justly express astonishment that Rome
should object to an investigation conducted by men whose minds were
already made up, or that she should complain because force was
employed to carry out a needed reform. Did the commissioners take a
few altar-cloths and decorate their horses? Did Rome never adorn
men in garments of shame and parade them through streets to be
mocked by the populace, and finally burned at the stake? Were the
altar-cloths dear to Catholic hearts? Were not the Bibles burned in
France, in Germany, in Spain, in Holland, in England, dear to the
hearts of the reformers? But however justifiable such a line of
argument may be, there is little to be gained by charging the sins
of the past against the men of to-day. Nevertheless, if these facts
and many like them were remembered, less would <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span> be said about the
cruelties that accompanied the suppression of the monasteries.</p>
<p>Were the charges against the monks true? It seems impossible to
doubt that in the main they were, although it should be admitted
that many monasteries were beyond reproach. Eliminating gross
exaggerations, lies and calumnies, there still remains a body of
evidence that compels the verdict of guilt. The legislation of the
church councils, the decrees of popes, the records of the courts,
the reports of investigating committees appointed by various popes,
the testimony of the orders against each other, the chronicles,
letters and other extant literature, abound in such detailed,
specific charges of monastic corruption that it is simply
preposterous to reject the testimony. All the efforts at
reformation, and they were many, had failed. Many bishops confessed
their inability to cope with the growing disorders. It is beyond
question that lay robbers were encouraged to perpetrate acts of
sacrilege because the monks were frequently guilty of forgery and
violence. Commenting upon the impression which monkish lawlessness
must have made upon the minds of such men as Wyclif, Pike says:
"They <span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>[pg 337]</span>
saw with their own eyes those wild and lawless scenes, the faint
reflection of which in contemporaneous documents may excite the
wonder of modern lawyers and modern moralists." The legislation of
church and state for a century before Henry VIII. shows that the
monks were guilty of brawling, frequenting taverns, indulging in
licentious pleasures and upholding unlawful games.</p>
<p>Bonaventura, the General of the Franciscan Order in its earliest
days, and its palmiest, for the first years of a monastic order
were always its best years--this mendicant, their pride and their
glory, tells us that within fifty years of the death of its founder
there were many mendicants roaming around in disorderly fashion,
brazen and shameless beggars of scandalous fame. This unenviable
record was kept up down to the days of Wyclif, who charged the
begging friars with representing themselves as holy and needy,
while they were robust of body, rich in possessions, and dwelt in
splendid houses, where they gave sumptuous banquets. What shall one
say of the hysterical ravings against Henry of the "Holy Maid of
Kent," whose fits and predictions were palmed off by five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>[pg 338]</span>
ecclesiastics, high in authority, as supernatural manifestations?
What must have been the state of monasteries in which such
meretricious schemes were hatched, to deceive silly people, thwart
the king and stop the movements for reform?</p>
<p>Moreover, the various attempts to reform or to suppress the
monasteries prior to Henry's time show he was simply carrying out
what, in a small way, had been attempted before. King John, Edward
I. and Edward III., had confiscated "alien priories." Richard II.
and Henry IV. had made similar raids. In 1410, the House of Commons
proposed the confiscation of all the temporalities held by bishops,
abbots and priors, that the money might be used for a standing
army, and to increase the income of the nobles and secular clergy.
It was not done, but the attempt shows the trend of public opinion
on the question of abolishing the monasteries. In 1416, Parliament
dissolved the alien priories and vested their estates in the crown.
There is extant a letter of Cardinal Morton, Legate of the
Apostolic See, and Archbishop of Canterbury, to the abbot of St.
Albans, one of the mightiest abbeys in all England. It was written
as the result <span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>[pg
339]</span> of an investigation started by Innocent VIII., in 1489.
In this communication the abbot and his monks were charged with the
grossest licentiousness, waste and thieving. Lina Eckenstein, in
her interesting work on "Woman Under Monasticism," says: "It were
idle to deny that the state of discipline in many houses was bad,
but the circumstances under which Morton's letter was penned argue
that the charges made in it should be accepted with some
reservation." In 1523, Cardinal Wolsey obtained bulls from the pope
authorizing the suppression of forty small monasteries, and the
application of their revenues to educational institutions, on the
ground that the houses were homes neither of religion nor of
learning.</p>
<p>What Henry did, every country in Europe has felt called upon to
do in one way or another. Germany, Italy, Spain, France have all
suppressed monasteries, and despite the suffering which attended
the dissolution in England, the step was taken with less loss of
life and less injury to the industrial welfare of the people than
anywhere else in Europe[<a href="#NOTE_J">J</a>]. Hooper, who was
made a bishop in the reign of <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page340"></a>[pg 340]</span> Edward VI., expressed the Protestant
view of Henry's reforms in a letter written about the year 1546.
"Our king," he says, "has destroyed the pope, but not popery....
The impious mass, the most shameful celibacy of the clergy, the
invocation of saints, auricular confession, superstitious
abstinence from meats, and purgatory, were never before held by the
people in greater esteem than at the present moment." In other
words, the independence of the Church of England was secured by
those who, if they were not Roman Catholics, were certainly closer
in faith to Rome than they were to Protestantism. The Protestant
doctrines did not become the doctrines of the Church of England
until the reign of Edward VI., and it was many years after that
before the separation from Rome was complete in doctrine as well as
respects the authority of the pope.</p>
<p>These facts indicate that there must have been other causes for
the success of the English Reformation than the greed or ambition
of the monarch. Those causes are easily discovered. One of them was
the hostility of the people to the alien priories. The origin of
the alien priories dates back to the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page341"></a>[pg 341]</span> Norman conquest. The Normans shared
the spoils of their victory with their continental friends. English
monasteries and churches were given to foreigners, who collected
the rents and other kinds of income. These foreign prelates had no
other interest in England than to derive all the profit they could
from their possessions. They appointed whom they pleased to live in
their houses, and the monks, being far away from their superiors,
became a source of constant annoyance to the English people. The
struggle against these alien priories had been carried on for many
years, and so many of them had been abolished that the people
became accustomed to the seizure of monasteries.</p>
<p>Large sums of money were annually paid to the pope, and the
English people were loudly complaining of the constant drain on
their resources. It was a common saying in the reign of Henry III.,
that "England is the pope's farm." The "Good Parliament," in 1376,
affirmed "that the taxes paid to the church of Rome amounted to
five times as much as those levied for the king; ... that the
brokers of the sinful city of Rome promoted for money unlearned and
unworthy caitiffs to benefices <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page342"></a>[pg 342]</span> of the value of a thousand marks,
while the poor and learned hardly obtain one of twenty." Various
laws, heartily supported by the clergy as well as by the civil
authorities, were enacted from time to time, aimed at the abuses of
papal power. So steadfast and strong was the opposition to the
interference of foreigners in English affairs, it would be possible
to show that there was an evolution in the struggle against Rome
that was certain to culminate in the separation, whether Henry had
accomplished it or not. What might have occurred if the monks had
reformed and the pope withdrawn his claims it is impossible to
know. The fact is that the monks grew worse instead of better, and
the arrogance of foreigners became more unendurable. "The
corruption of the church establishment, in fact," says Lea, "had
reached a point which the dawning enlightenment of the age could
not much longer endure.... Intoxicated with centuries of
domination, the muttered thunders of growing popular discontent
were unheeded, and its claims to spiritual and temporal authority
were asserted with increasing vehemence, while its corruptions were
daily displayed before the people with more careless <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>[pg 343]</span> cynicism." In view
of this condition of affairs, the existence of which even the
adherents of modern Rome must acknowledge, one cannot but wonder
that the ruin of the monasteries should be attributed to Henry's
desire "to overthrow the rights of women, to degrade matrimony and
to practice concubinage." Such an explanation is too superficial;
it ignores a multitude of historical facts.</p>
<p>The monasteries had to fall if England was to be saved from the
horrors of civil war, if the hand of the pope was to remain
uplifted from her, if the insecure gains of the Reformation were to
become established and glorious achievements; if, in fact, all
those benefits accompanying human progress were to become the
heritage of succeeding ages.</p>
<p>Whatever benefits the monks had conferred upon mankind, and
these were neither few nor slight, they had become fetters on the
advancement of freedom, education and true religion. They were the
standing army of the pope, occupying the last and strongest
citadel. They were the unyielding advocates of an ideal that was
passing away. It was sad to see the Carthusian house fall, but in
spite of the high character of its inmates, it was a part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>[pg 344]</span> an
institution that stood for the right of foreigners to rule England.
It was unfortunate they had thrown themselves down before the car
of progress but there they were; they would not get up; the car
must roll on, for so God himself had decreed, and hence they were
crushed in its advance. Their martyrdom was truly a poor return for
their virtues, but there never has been a moral or political
revolution that has furthered the general well-being of humanity,
in which just and good men have not suffered. It would be
delightful if freedom and progress could be secured, and effete
institutions destroyed or reformed, without the accompaniment of
disaster and death, but it is not so.</p>
<p>The monks stood for opposition to reform, and therefore came
into direct conflict with the king, who was blindly groping his way
toward the future, and who was, in fact, the unconscious agent of
many reform forces that concentrated in him. He did not comprehend
the significance of his proceedings. He did not take up the cause
of the English people with the pure and intelligent motive of
encouraging free thought and free religion. He did not realize that
he was leading the mighty army of Protestant <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>[pg 345]</span> reformers. He
little dreamed that the people whose cause he championed would in
turn assert their rights and make it impossible for an English
sovereign to enjoy the absolute authority which he wielded. Truly
"there is a power, not ourselves," making for freedom, progress and
truth.</p>
<p>Thus a number of causes brought on the ruin of the monasteries.
Henry's need of money; the refusal of the monks to sign the acts of
supremacy and succession; the general drift of reform, and the
iniquity of the monks. They fell from natural causes and through
the operation of laws which God alone controls. As Hill neatly puts
it, "Monasticism was healthy, active and vigorous; it became idle,
listless and extravagant; it engendered its own corruption, and out
of that corruption came death."</p>
<p>Richard Bagot, a Catholic, in a recent article on the question,
"Will England become Catholic?" which was published in the "Nuova
Antologia," says: "Though it is impossible not to blame the
so-called Reformers for the acts of sacrilege and barbarism through
which they obtained the religious and political liberty so
necessary to the intellectual and social progress of the race, it
cannot be denied <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>[pg
346]</span> that no sooner had the power of the papacy come to an
end in England than the English nation entered upon that free
development which has at last brought it to its present position
among the other nations of the world." Mr. Bagot also admits that
"the political intrigues and insatiable ambition of the papacy
during the succeeding centuries constituted a perpetual menace to
England."</p>
<p>The true view, therefore, is that two types of religious and
political life, two epochs of human history, met in Henry's reign.
The king and the pope were the exponents of conflicting ideals. The
fall of the monasteries was an incident in the struggle. "The
Catholics," says Froude, "had chosen the alternative, either to
crush the free thought which was bursting from the soil, or to be
crushed by it; and the future of the world could not be sacrificed
to preserve the exotic graces of medieval saints."</p>
<p>The problem is reduced to this, Was the Reformation desirable?
Is Protestantism a curse or a blessing? Would England and the world
be better off under the sway of medieval religion than under the
influence of modern Protestantism? If <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>[pg 347]</span> monasticisrn were a
fetter on human liberty and industry, if the monasteries were "so
many seminaries of superstition and of folly," there was but one
thing to do--to break the fetters and to destroy the monasteries.
To have succeeded in so radical a reform as that begun by King
Henry, with forty thousand monks preaching treason, would have been
an impossibility. Henry cannot be blamed because the monks chose to
entangle themselves with politics and to side with Rome as against
the English nation.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="Results_of_the_Dissolution"></a>Results of the
Dissolution</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Many important results followed the fall of the monasteries. The
majority of the House of Lords was now transferred from the abbots
to the lay peers. The secular clergy, who had been fighting the
monks for centuries, were at last accorded their proper standing in
the church. Numerous unjust ecclesiastical privileges were swept
aside, and in many respects the whole church was strengthened and
purified. Credulity and superstition began to decline.
Ecclesiastical criminals were no longer able <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span> to escape the just
penalty for their crimes. Naturally all these beneficent ends were
not attained immediately. For a while there was great disorder and
distress. Society was disturbed not only by the stoppage of
monastic alms-giving, but the wandering monks, unaccustomed to toil
and without a trade, increased the confusion.</p>
<p>In this connection it is well to point out that some writers
make very much of the poverty relieved by the monks, and claim that
the nobles, into whose hands the monastic lands fell, did almost
nothing to mitigate the distresses of the unfortunate. But they
ignore the fact that a blind and undiscriminating charity was the
cause, and not the cure, of much of the miserable wretchedness of
the poor. Modern society has learned that the monastic method is
wholly wrong; that fraud and laziness are fostered by a wholesale
distribution of doles. The true way to help the poor is to enable
the poor to assist themselves; to teach them trades and give them
work. The sociological methods of to-day are thoroughly
anti-monastic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the infidel Zosimus, quoted by Gibbon, was
not far wrong when he said "the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page349"></a>[pg 349]</span> monks robbed an empire to help a few
beggars." The fact that the religious houses did distribute alms
and entertain strangers is not disputed; indeed it is pleasant to
reflect upon this noble charity of the monks; it is a bright spot
in their history. But it is in no sense true that they deserve all
the credit for relieving distress. They received the money for alms
in the shape of rents, gifts and other kinds of income. Hallam
says, "There can be no doubt that many of the impotent poor derived
support from their charity. But the blind eleemosynary spirit
inculcated by the Romish church is notoriously the cause, not the
cure, of beggary and wickedness. The monastic foundations,
scattered in different countries, could never answer the ends of
local and limited succor. Their gates might, indeed, be open to
those who knocked at them for alms.... Nothing could have a
stronger tendency to promote that vagabond mendicity which severe
statutes were enacted to repress."</p>
<p>It seems almost ungracious to quote such an observation, because
it may be distorted into a criticism of charity itself, or made to
serve the purposes of certain anti-Romanists who cannot even spare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>[pg 350]</span> those
noble women who minister to the sick in the home or hospital from
their bigoted criticisms. Small indeed must be the soul of that man
who permits his religious opinions to blind his eyes to the
inestimable services of those heroic and self-sacrificing women.
But even Roman Catholic students of social problems must recognize
the folly of indiscriminate alms-giving. "In proportion as justice
between man and man has declined, that form of charity which
consists in giving money has been more quickened." The promotion of
industry, the repression of injustice, the encouragement of
self-reliance and thrift, are needed far more than the temporary
relief of those who suffer from oppression or from their own
wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Some of those who deplore the fall of the monasteries make much
of the fact that the modern world is menaced by materialism. "With
very rare exceptions," cries Maitre, a French Catholic, "the most
undisguised materialism has everywhere replaced the lessons and
recollections of the spiritual life. The shrill voice of machinery,
the grinding of the saw or the monotonous clank of the piston, is
heard now, where once were heard chants and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page351"></a>[pg 351]</span> prayers and
confessions. Once the monk freely undid the door to let the
stranger in, and now we see a sign, 'no admittance,' lest a greedy
rival purloin the tricks of trade." Montalembert, referring to the
ruin of the cloisters in France, grieves thus: "Sometimes the
spinning-wheel is installed under the ancient sanctuary. Instead of
echoing night and day the praises of God, these dishonored arches
too often repeat only the blasphemies of obscene cries." The
element of truth in these laments gives them their sting, but one
should beware of the fervid rhetoric of the worshipers of
medievalism. This century is nobler, purer, truer, manlier, and
more humane than any of the centuries that saw the greatest
triumphs of the monks. They, too, had their blasphemies, often
under the cloak of piety; they, too, had their obscene cries. Their
superstitions and frauds concealed beneath those "dishonored
arches" were infinitely worse than the noise of machinery weaving
garments for the poor, or producing household comforts to increase
the happiness of the humblest man.</p>
<p>There is much that is out of joint, much to justify doleful
prophecies, in the social and religious <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span> conditions of the
present age, but the signs of the times are not all ominous. At all
events, nothing would be gained by a return to the monkish ideals
of the past. The hope of the world lies in the further development
and completer realization of those great principles of human
freedom that distinguish this century from the past. The history of
monasticism clearly shows that the monasteries could not minister
to that development of liberty, truth and justice, which constitute
the indispensable condition of human happiness and human progress.
Unable to adjust themselves to the new age, unwilling to welcome
the new light, rejecting the doctrine of individual freedom, the
monks were forced to retire from the field.</p>
<p>So fell in England that institution which, for twelve centuries,
had exercised marvelous dominion over the spiritual and temporal
interests of the continent, and for eight hundred years had
suffered or thrived on English soil. "The day came, and that a
drear winter day, when its last mass was sung, its last censer
waved, its last congregation bent in rapt and lovely adoration
before the altar." Its <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page353"></a>[pg 353]</span> majestic and solemn ruins proclaim
its departed grandeur. Its deeds of mercy, its conflicts with kings
and bishops, its prayers and chants and penances, its virtues and
its vices, its trials and its victories, its wealth and its
poverty, all are gone. Silence and death keep united watch over
cloister and tomb. We should be ungrateful if we forgot its
blessings; we should be untrue if, ignoring its evils, we sought to
bring back to life that which God has laid in the sepulcher of the
dead.</p>
<blockquote>"Where pleasant was the spot for men to dwell,<br>
Amid its fair broad lands the abbey lay,<br>
Sheltering dark orgies that were shame to tell,<br>
And cowled and barefoot beggars swarmed the way,<br>
All in their convent weeds of black, and white, and gray.<br>
<br>
From many a proud monastic pile, o'erthrown,<br>
Fear-struck, the brooded inmates rushed and fled;<br>
The web, that for a thousand years had grown<br>
O'er prostrate Europe, in that day of dread<br>
Crumbled and fell, as fire dissolves the flaxen thread."<br>

<h2><i><a name="CAUSES_AND_IDEALS_OF_MONASTICISM"></a>CAUSES AND
IDEALS OF MONASTICISM</i></h2>
<br>
<p>All forms of religious character and conduct are grounded in
certain cravings of the soul, which, in seeking satisfaction, are
influenced by theoretical opinions. The longings of the human heart
constitute the impulse, or the energy, of religion. The
intellectual convictions act as guiding forces. As a religious
type, therefore, the monk was produced by the action of certain
desires, influenced by specific opinions respecting God, the soul,
the body, the world and their relations.</p>
<p>The existence of monasticism in non-Christian religions implies
that whatever impetus the ascetic impulses in human nature received
from Christian teaching, there is some broader basis for monastic
life than the tenets of any creed. Biblical history and Christian
theology furnish some explanation <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page355"></a>[pg 355]</span> of the rise of Christian monasticism,
but they do not account for the monks of ancient India. The
teachings of Jesus exerted a profound influence upon the Christian
monks, but they cannot explain the Oriental asceticism that
flourished before the Christ of the New Testament was born. There
must have been some motive, or motives, operating on human nature
as such, a knowledge of which will help to account for the monks of
Indian antiquity as well as the begging friars of modern times. It
will therefore be in order to begin the present inquiry by seeking
those causes which gave rise to monasticism in general.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="Causative_Motives_of_Monasticism"></a>Causative
Motives of Monasticism</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Whatever the origin of religion itself, it is certain that it is
man's inalienable concern. He is, as Sabatier says, "incurably
religious." Of all the motives ministering to this ruling passion,
the longing for righteousness and for the favor of God is supreme.
The savage only partially grasps the significance of his spiritual
aspirations, and dimly understands the nature of the God he adores
or fears. His worship <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page356"></a>[pg 356]</span> may be confined to frantic efforts to
ward off the vengeful assaults of an angry deity, but however gross
his religious conceptions, there is at the heart of his religion a
desire to live in peaceful relations with the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>As religion advances, the ethical character of God and the
nature of true righteousness are more clearly apprehended. But the
idea that moral purity and fellowship with God are in some way
associated with self-denial has always been held by the religious
world. But what does such a conception involve? What must one do to
deny self? The answer to that question will vastly influence the
form of religious conduct. Thus while all religious men may unite
in a craving for holiness by a participation in the Divine nature,
they will differ widely in their opinions as to the nature of this
desirable righteousness and as to the means by which it may be
attained. Roman Catholicism, by the voice of the monk, whom it
regards as the highest type of Christian living, gives one answer
to these questions; Protestantism, protesting against asceticism,
gives a different reply.</p>
<p>The desire for salvation was, therefore, the primary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span> cause
of all monasticism. Many quotations might be given from the sacred
writings of India, establishing beyond dispute, that underlying the
confusing variety of philosophical ideas and ascetic practices of
the non-Christian monks, was a consuming desire for the redemption
of the soul from sin. Buddha said on seeing a mendicant, "The life
of a devotee has always been praised by the wise. It will be my
refuge and the refuge of other creatures, it will lead us to a real
life, to happiness and immortality."</p>
<p>Dharmapala, in expounding the teachings of the Buddha, at the
World's Parliament of Religions, in Chicago, clearly showed that
the aim of the Buddhist is "the entire obliteration of all that is
evil," and "the complete purification of the mind." That this is
the purpose of the asceticism of India is seen by the following
quotation from Dharmapala's address: "The advanced student of the
religion of Buddha when he has faith in him thinks: 'Full of
hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passions; free as
the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things.
How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home to live the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span> higher
life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its perfection!
Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in
orange-colored robes and let me go forth from a household life into
the homeless state!'"</p>
<p>In the same parliament, Mozoomdar, the brilliant and attractive
representative of the Brahmo Somaj, in describing "Asia's Service
to Religion," thus stated the motives and spirit of Oriental
asceticism: "What lesson do the hermitages, the monasteries, the
cave temples, the discipline and austerities of the religious East
teach the world? Renunciation. The Asiatic apostle will ever remain
an ascetic, a celibate, a homeless Akinchana, a Fakeer. We
Orientals are all the descendants of John the Baptist. Any one who
has taken pains at spiritual culture must admit that the great
enemy to a devout concentration of mind is the force of bodily and
worldly desire. Communion with God is impossible, so long as the
flesh and its lusts are not subdued.... It is not mere temperance,
but positive asceticism; not mere self-restraint, but
self-mortification; not mere self-sacrifice, but self-extinction;
not mere morality, but absolute holiness." And <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span> further on in his
address, Mozoomdar claimed that this asceticism is practically the
essential principle in Christianity and the meaning of the cross of
Christ: "This great law of self-effacement, poverty, suffering,
death, is symbolized in the mystic cross so dear to you and dear to
me. Christians, will you ever repudiate Calvary? Oneness of will
and character is the sublimest and most difficult unity with God."
The chief value of these quotations from Mozoomdar lies in the fact
that they show forth the underlying motive of all asceticism. It
would be unjust to the distinguished scholar to imply that he
defends those extreme forms of monasticism which have appeared in
India or in Christian countries. On the contrary, while he
maintains, in his charming work, "The Oriental Christ," that "the
height of self-denial may fitly be called asceticism," he is at the
same time fully alive to its dangerous exaggerations. "Pride," he
says, "creeps into the holiest and humblest exercises of
self-discipline. It is the supremest natures only that escape. The
practice of asceticism therefore is always attended with great
danger." The language of Mozoomdar, however, like that of many
Christian monastic writers, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page360"></a>[pg 360]</span> opens the door to many grave
excesses. It is another evidence of the necessity for defining what
one means by "self-mortification" and "self-extinction."</p>
<p>Turning now to Christian monasticism, it will be found that, as
in the case of Oriental monasticism the yearning for victory over
self was uppermost in the minds of the best Christian monks. A few
words from a letter written by Jerome to Rusticus, a young monk,
illustrates the truth of this observation: "Let your garments be
squalid," he says, "to show that your mind is white, and your tunic
coarse, to show that you despise the world. But give not way to
pride, lest your dress and your language be found at variance.
Baths stimulate the senses, and are therefore to be avoided."</p>
<p>To keep the mind white, to despise the world, to overcome pride,
to stop the craving of the senses for gratification,--these were
the objects of the monks, in order to accomplish which they
macerated and starved their bodies, avoided baths, wore rags,
affected humble language and fled from the scenes of pleasure. The
goal was highly commendable, even if the means employed were
inadequate to produce the desired results.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span>
<p>All down through the Middle Ages, the idea continued to prevail
that the monastic life was the highest and purest expression of the
Christian religion, and that the monks' chances of heaven were much
better than those of any other class of men. The laity believed
them to be a little nearer God than even the clergy, and so they
paid them gold for their prayers. It will readily be understood
that in degenerate times, so profitable a doctrine would be
earnestly encouraged by the monks. The knight, whose conscience
revolted against his conduct but who could not bring himself to a
complete renunciation of the world, believed that heaven would
condone his faults or crimes if in some way he could make friends
with the dwellers in the cloister. To this end, he founded abbeys
and sustained monasteries by liberal gifts of gold and land. Such a
donation was made in the following language: "I, Gervais, who
belong to the chivalry of the age, caring for the salvation of my
soul, and considering that I shall never reach God by my own
prayers and fastings, have resolved to recommend myself in some
other way to those who, night and day, serve God by these
practices, so that, thanks <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page362"></a>[pg 362]</span> to their intercession, I may be able
to obtain that salvation which I of myself am unable to merit."
Another endowment was made by Peter, Knight of Maull, in these
quaint terms: "I, Peter, profiting by this lesson, and desirous,
though a sinner and unworthy, to provide for my future destiny, I
have desired that the bees of God may come to gather their honey in
my orchards, so that when their fair hives shall be full of rich
combs, they may be able to remember him by whom the hive was
given."</p>
<p>The people believed that the prayers of the monks lifted their
souls into heaven; that their curses doomed them to the bottomless
pit. A monastery was the safe and sure road to heaven. The
observation of Gibbon respecting the early monks is applicable to
all of them: "Each proselyte who entered the gates of a monastery
was persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny path of eternal
happiness."</p>
<p>The second cause for monasticism in general was a natural love
of solitude, which became almost irresistible when reinforced by a
despair of the world's redemption. The poet voiced the feelings of
almost every soul, at some period in life, when he wrote:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span>
<blockquote>"O for a lodge in some vast wilderness,<br>
Some boundless contiguity of shade,<br>
Where rumor of oppression or deceit,<br>
Of unsuccessful or successful war,<br>
Might never reach me more."</blockquote>
<p>The longing for solitude accompanied the desire for salvation.
An unconquerable weariness of the world, with its strife and
passion, overcame the seeker after God. A yearning to escape the
duties of social life, which were believed to interfere with one's
duty to God, possessed his soul. The flight from the world was
merely the method adopted to satisfy his soul-longings. If such
times of degeneracy and rampant iniquity ever return, if humanity
is again compelled to stagger under the moral burdens that crushed
the Roman Empire, without doubt the love of solitude, which is now
held in check by the satisfactions of a comparatively pure and
peaceful social life, will again arise in its old-time strength and
impel men to seek in waste and lonely places the virtues they
cannot acquire in a decaying civilization.</p>
<p>Even amid the delights of human fellowship, and surrounded by so
much that ministers to restfulness of soul, it is often hard to
repress a longing to <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page364"></a>[pg 364]</span> shatter the fetters of custom, to
flee from the noise and confusion of this hurrying, fretful world,
and to pass one's days in a coveted retirement, far from the
maddening strife and tumult. Montalembert's profound appreciation
of monastic life was never more aptly illustrated than in the
following declaration: "In the depths of human nature there exists
without doubt, a tendency instinctive, though confused and
evanescent, toward retirement and solitude. What man, unless
completely depraved by vice or weighed down by care and cupidity,
has not experienced once, at least, before his death, the
attraction of solitude?"</p>
<p>While the motives just described were unquestionably preeminent
among the causative factors in monasticism, it should not be taken
for granted that there were no others, or that either or both of
these motives controlled every monk. The personal considerations
tending to keep up the flight from the world were numerous and
active. It would be a mistake to credit all the monks, and at some
periods even a majority of them, with pure and lofty purposes.
Oftentimes criminals were pardoned <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page365"></a>[pg 365]</span> through the intercession of abbots on
condition that they would retire to a monastery. The jilted lover
and the commercial bankrupt, the deserted or bereaved wife, the
pauper and the invalid, the social outcast and the shirker of civic
duties, the lazy and the fickle were all to be found in the ranks
of the monastic orders. Ceasing to feel any interest in the joys of
society, they had turned to the cloister as a welcome asylum in the
hour of their sorrow or disappointment. To some it was an easy way
out of the struggle for existence, to others it meant an end to
taxes and to military service, to still others it was a haven of
rest for a weary body or a disappointed spirit. Thus many specific,
individual considerations acted with the general desires for
salvation and solitude to strengthen and to perpetuate the
institution.</p>

<br>
<h2><i><a name=
"Beliefs_Affecting_the_Causative_Motives"></a>Beliefs Affecting the
Causative Motives</i></h2>
<br>
<p>In the first chapter it was shown that a variety of views
respecting the relation of the body and the soul influenced the
origin and development of Christian monasticism. It will not now be
necessary <span class="pagenum"><a name="page366"></a>[pg
366]</span> to repeat what was there said. The essential teaching
of all these false opinions was that the body was in itself evil,
that the gratification of natural appetites was inherently wrong,
and that true holiness consisted in the complete subjection of the
body by self-denial and torture. Jerome distinctly taught that what
was natural was opposed to God. The Gnostics and many of the early
Christians believed that this world was ruled by the devil. The
Gnostics held that this opposition of the kingdom of matter to God
was fundamental and eternal. The Christians, however, maintained
that the antagonism was temporary, the Lord having given the world
over to evil spirits for a time. The prevailing opinion among
almost all schools was that a union with God was only possible to
those who had extinguished bodily desires.</p>
<p>The ascetic theory undoubtedly derived much support from the
views held concerning the teachings of the Bible. The Oriental
monks frequently quoted from their sacred books to justify their
habits and ideals. In like manner, the Christian monks believed
that they, and they alone, were literally obeying the commands of
Christ and his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>[pg
367]</span> apostles. This phase of the subject will receive
attention when the three vows of monasticism are considered.</p>
<p>In the West, two conditions, one political and social, the other
religious, set in motion all these spiritual desires and ascetic
beliefs tending toward monasticism. One was the corrupted state, of
Roman society and the approaching overthrow of the Roman Empire.
The other was the secularization of the church.</p>
<p>Men naturally cling to society as long as there exists any
well-founded hope for its regeneration, but when every expectation
for the survival of righteousness yields to a conviction that doom
is inevitable, then the flight from the world begins. This was
precisely the situation in the declining days of Rome and
Alexandria, when Christian monasticism came into being. The monks
believed that the end of the world was nigh, that all things
temporal and earthly were doomed, and that God's hand was against
the empire. "That they were correct in their judgment of the world
about them," says Kingsley, "contemporary history proves
abundantly. That they were correct, likewise, in believing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span> some
fearful judgment was about to fall on man, is proved by the fact
that it did fall."</p>
<p>So they fled to escape being caught in the ruins of society's
tottering structure,--fled to make friends with the angels and with
God. If one cannot live purely in the midst of corruption, by all
means let him live purely away from corruption, but let him never
forget that his piety is of a lower order than that which abides
uncorrupted in the midst of degenerate society. There is much truth
in the observation of Charles Reade in "The Cloister and the
Hearth": "So long as Satan walks the whole earth, tempting men, and
so long as the sons of Belial do never lock themselves in caves but
run like ants, to and fro corrupting others, the good man that
sulks apart, plays the Devil's game, or at least gives him the
odds."</p>
<p>But the early Christian monks believed that their safety was
only in flight. It was not altogether an unworthy motive; at least
it is easy to sympathize with these men struggling against odds, of
the magnitude of which the modern Christian has only the faintest
conception.</p>
<p>The conviction that the only true and certain <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>[pg 369]</span> way to secure
salvation is by flight from the world, continued to prevail during
the succeeding centuries of monastic history, and it can hardly be
said to have entirely disappeared even at the present time. Anselm
of Canterbury, in the twelfth century, wrote to a young friend
reminding him that the glory of this world was perishing. True, not
monks only are saved, "but," says he, "who attains to salvation in
the most certain, who in the most noble way, the man who seeks to
love God alone, or he who seeks to unite the love of God with the
love of the world?... Is it rational when danger is on every side,
to remain where it is the greatest?"</p>
<p>The Christian church set up an ideal of life which it was
impossible to realize within her borders, and one which differed in
many respects from the teachings of Jesus. Her demands involved a
renunciation of the world, a superiority to all the enticements of
bodily appetites, a lofty scorn of secular bonds and social
concerns. A vigorous religious faith had conquered a mighty empire,
but corruption attended its victory. The standard of Christian
morals was lowered, or had at least degenerated <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page370"></a>[pg 370]</span> into a cold, formal
ideal that no one was expected to realize; hence none strove to
attain it but the monks. When Roman society with its selfishness,
lust and worldliness, swept in through the open doors of the church
and took possession of the sanctuary, those who had cherished the
ascetic ideal gave up the fight against the world, and the flight
from the world-church began. They could not tolerate this union of
the church with a pagan state and an effete civilization. In some
respects, as a few writers maintain, many of these hermits were
like the old Jewish prophets, fighting single-handed against
corruption in church and state, refusing to yield themselves as
slaves to the authority of institutions that had forsaken the
ideals of the past.</p>
<p>Thus the conviction that the end of human society was nigh, and
that the church could no longer serve as an asylum for the lovers
of righteousness, with certain philosophical ideas respecting the
body, the world and God, united to produce the assumption that
salvation was more readily attainable in the deserts; and Christian
monasticism, in its hermit form, began its long and eventful
history.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Causes_of_Variations_in_Monasticism"></a>Causes of
Variations in Monasticism</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Prominent among the causes producing variations in the monastic
type was the influence of climatic conditions and race
characteristics.</p>
<p>The monasticism as well as the religion of the East has always
differed from the monasticism and the religion of the West. The
Eastern mind is mystical, dreamy, contemplative; the Western mind
loves activity, is intensely practical. Representatives of the
Eastern faiths in the recent Parliament of Religions accused the
West of materialism, of loving the body more than the soul. They
affected to despise all material prosperity, and gloried in their
assumed superiority, on account of their love for religious
contemplation. This radical difference between the races of the
East and West is clearly seen in the monastic institution. Benedict
embodied in his rules the spirit and active life of the West, and
hence, the monastic system, then in danger of dying, or stagnating,
revived and spread all over Europe. Again, the hermit life was
ill-adapted to the West. Men could not live out of doors in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>[pg 372]</span> Europe
and subsist on small quantities of food as in Egypt. The rigors of
the climate in Europe demanded an adaptation to new conditions.</p>
<p>But aside from the differences between Eastern and Western
monasticism, the Christian institution passed through a variety of
changes. The growth of monasticism from the hermit stage to the
cloistral life has already been described. To what shall the
development of the community system be attributed? No religious
institution can remain stationary, unaffected by the changing
conditions of the society in which it exists. The progress of the
intellect, and the development of social, political and industrial
conditions, effect great transformations in religious
organizations.</p>
<p>The monastic institution grew up amid the radical changes of
European society. In its early days it witnessed the invasion of
the barbarians, which swept away old political divisions and
destroyed many of the heritages of an ancient civilization. Then
the process of reconstruction slowly began. New states were
forming; nations were crystallizing. The barbarian was to lay the
foundations of great cities and organize powerful <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>[pg 373]</span> commonwealths out
of wild but victorious tribes. The monk could not remain in hiding.
He was brother to the roving warrior. The blood in his veins was
too active to permit him to stand still amid the mighty whirl of
events. Without entirely abandoning his cloistral life, he became a
zealous missionary of the church among the barbarians, a patron of
letters and of agriculture, in short a stirring participant in the
work of civilization.</p>
<p>Next came the crusades. Jerusalem was to be captured for Christ
and the church. The monk then appeared as a crusade-preacher, a
warrior on the battle-field, or a nurse in the military
hospital.</p>
<p>The rise of feudalism likewise wrought a change in the spirit
and position of the monks. The feudal lord was master of his
vassals. "The genius of feudalism," says Allen, "was a spirit of
uncontrolled independence." So the abbot became a feudal lord with
immense possessions and powers. He was no longer the obscure,
spiritual father of a little family of monks, but a temporal lord
also, an aristocrat, ruling wide territories, and dwelling in a
monastery little different from the castle of the knight and often
exceeding it in splendor. With <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page374"></a>[pg 374]</span> wealth came ease, and hard upon the
heels of ease came laziness, arrogance, corruption.</p>
<p>Then followed the marvelous intellectual awakening, the moral
revival, the discoveries and inventions of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. The human mind at last had aroused itself from
a long repose, or turned from a profitless activity into broad and
fruitful fields. The corruption of the monasteries meant the laxity
of vows, the cessation of ministration to the poor and the sick.
Then arose the tender and loving Francis, with his call to poverty
and to service. The independent exercise of the intellect gave
birth to heresies, but the Dominicans appeared to preach them
down.</p>
<p>The growth of the secular spirit and the progress of the new
learning were too much for the old monasticism. The monk had to
adapt himself to a new age, an age that is impatient of mere
contemplation, that spurns the rags of the begging friar and rebels
against the fierce intolerance of the Dominican preaching. So,
lastly, came the suave, determined, practical, cultured Jesuit,
ready to comply, at least outwardly, with all the requirements of
modern times. Does the new age reject monastic <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>[pg 375]</span> seclusion? Very
well, the Jesuit throws off his monastic garb and forsakes his
cloister, to take his place among men. Are the ignorance and the
filth of the begging friars offensive? The Jesuit is cultured,
affable and spotlessly clean. Does the new age demand liberty?
"Liberty," cries the Jesuit, "is the divine prerogative, colossal
in proportion, springing straight from the broad basin of the
soul's essence!"</p>
<p>Such in its merest outlines is the story of the development of
the monastic type and its causes.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Fundamental_Monastic_Vows"></a>The Fundamental
Monastic Vows</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The ultimate monastic ideal was the purification of the soul,
but when translated into definite, concrete terms, the immediate
aim of the monk was to live a life of poverty, celibacy and
obedience. Riches, marriage and self-will were regarded as forms of
sinful gratification, which every holy man should abandon. The true
Christian, according to monasticism, is poor, celibate and
obedient. The three fundamental monastic vows should therefore
receive special consideration.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>[pg 376]</span>
<p>1. The Vow of Poverty. The monks of all countries held the
possession of riches to be a barrier to high spiritual attainments.
In view of the fact that an inordinate love of wealth has proved
disastrous to many nations, and that it is extremely difficult for
a rich man to escape the hardening, enervating and corrupting
influences of affluence, the position of the monks on this question
is easily understood. The Christian monks based their vow of
poverty upon the Bible, and especially upon the teachings of
Christ, who, though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor. He
said to the rich young man, "Sell all that thou hast and give to
the poor." In commissioning the disciples to preach the gospel He
said: "Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes." In the
discourse on counting the cost of discipleship, He said: "So
therefore, whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he
hath, he cannot be my disciple." He promised rewards to "every one
that left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
children, or lands for my name's sake." "It is easier," He once
said, "for a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>[pg
377]</span> camel to go through a needle's eye than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven." He portrayed the pauper Lazarus as
participating in the joys of heaven, while the rich Dives endured
the torments of the lost. As reported in Luke, He said, "Blessed
are ye poor." He Himself was without a place to lay His head, a
houseless wanderer upon the earth.</p>
<p>The apostle James cries to the men of wealth: "Go to now, ye
rich men, weep and howl, for your miseries that shall come upon
you." John said: "Love not the world, neither the things that are
in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is
not in him."</p>
<p>Whatever these passages, and many others of like import, may
signify, it is not at all strange that Christians, living in times
when wealth was abused, and when critical Biblical scholarship was
unknown, should have understood Christ to command a life of poverty
as an indispensable condition of true holiness.</p>
<p>There are three ways of interpreting Christ's doctrine of
wealth. First, it may be held that Jesus intended His teachings to
be literally obeyed, not <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page378"></a>[pg 378]</span> only by His first disciples but by
all His followers in subsequent years, and that such literal
obedience is practicable, reasonable and conducive to the highest
well-being of society. Secondly, it has been said that Jesus was a
gentle and honest visionary, who erroneously believed that the
possession of riches rendered religious progress impossible, but
that strict compliance with His commands would be destructive of
civilization. Laveleye declares that "if Christianity were taught
and understood conformably to the spirit of its Founder, the
existing social organism could not last a day." Thirdly, neither of
these views seems to do justice to the spirit of Christ, for they
fail to give proper recognition to many other injunctions of the
Master and to many significant incidents in his public ministry.
Exhaustive treatment of this subject is, of course, impossible
here. Briefly it may be remarked, that Jesus looked upon wealth as
tending oftentimes to foster an unsocial spirit. Rich men are
liable to become enemies of the brotherhood Jesus sought to
establish, by reason of their covetousness and contracted
sympathies. The rich man is in danger of erecting false standards
of manhood, of ignoring the highest <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page379"></a>[pg 379]</span> interests of the soul by an undue
emphasis on the material. Wealth, in itself, is not an evil, but it
is only a good when it is used to advance the real welfare of
humanity. Jesus was not intent upon teaching economics. His purpose
was to develop the man. It was the moral value and spiritual
influence of material things that concerned him. Professor Shailer
Mathews admirably states the true attitude of Jesus towards rich
men: "Jesus was a friend neither of the working man nor the rich
man as such. He calls the poor man to sacrifice as well as the rich
man. He was the Son of Man, not the son of a class of men. But His
denunciation is unsparing of those men who make wealth at the
expense of souls; who find in capital no incentive to further
fraternity; who endeavor so to use wealth as to make themselves
independent of social obligations, and to grow fat with that which
should be shared with society;--for those men who are gaining the
world but are letting their neighbors fall among thieves and
Lazarus rot among their dogs."</p>
<p>Jesus was therefore not a foe to rich men as such, but to that
antisocial, abnormal regard for wealth and its procurements, which
leads to the creation <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page380"></a>[pg 380]</span> of class distinctions and impedes the
full and free development of our common humanity along the lines of
brotherly love and co&ouml;peration. A Christian may consistently
be a rich man, provided he uses his wealth in furthering the true
interests of society, and realizes, as respects his own person,
that "a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
which he possesseth." The error of monasticism consists in making
poverty a virtue and an essential condition of the highest
holiness. It is true that some callings preclude the prospect of
fortune. The average clergyman cannot hope to amass wealth. The
resident of a social settlement may possess capacities that would
win success in business, but he must forego financial prospects if
he expects to live and labor among the poor. In so far as the monks
deliberately turned their backs on the material rewards of human
endeavors that they might be free to devote themselves to the
service of humanity, their vow of poverty was creditable and
reasonable. But they erred when they exalted poverty as of itself
commending them in a peculiar degree to the mercy of God.</p>
<p>2. The Vow of Celibacy. "The moral merit <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>[pg 381]</span> of celibacy," says
Allen, "was harder to make out of the Scripture, doubtless, since
family life is both at the foundation of civil society and the
source of all the common virtues." The monks held that Christ and
Paul both taught and practiced celibacy. In the early and middle
ages celibacy was looked upon by all churchmen as in itself a
virtue. The prevailing modern idea is that marriage is a holy
institution, in no sense inferior in sacredness to any
ecclesiastical order of life. He who antagonizes it plays into the
hands of the foes to social purity and individual virtue.</p>
<p>The ideas of Jerome, Ambrose, and all the early Fathers,
respecting marriage, are still held by many ecclesiastics. One of
them, in defending the celibacy of existing religious orders, says:
"Celibacy is enjoined on these religious orders as a means to
greater sanctification, greater usefulness, greater absorption in
things spiritual, and to facilitate readier withdrawal from things
earthly." He gives two reasons for the celibacy of the priesthood,
which are all the more interesting because they substantially
represent the opinions held by the Christian monks in all ages:
First, "That the service of the priest <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>[pg 382]</span> to God may be
undivided and unrestrained." In support of this, he quotes I. Cor.,
7: 32, 33, which reads: "But I would have you free from cares. He
that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may
please the Lord: but he that is married is careful for the things
of the world, how he may please his wife." And secondly,
"Celibacy," according to Trent, "is more blessed than marriage." He
also quotes the words of Christ that there are "eunuchs for the
kingdom of heaven's sake." He then adds: "It is desirable that
those called to the ministry of the altar espouse a life of
continence because holier and more angelic."</p>
<p>It is generally admitted that the vow of celibacy was not
demanded of the clergy in primitive Christian times. It was only
after many years of bitter debate and in response to the growing
influence of the monastic ideal, that celibacy finally came to be
looked upon as the highest form of Christian virtue, and was
enforced upon the clergy. As in the case of the vow of poverty,
there certainly can be no reasonable objection to the individual
adoption of celibacy, if one is either disinclined to marriage or
feels that he can do better work unmarried. But <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span> neither Scripture
nor reason justifies the imposition of celibacy upon any man, nor
the view that a life of continence is holier than marriage. It may
be reverently said that God would be making an unreasonable demand
upon mankind, if the holiness He requires conflicted with the
proper satisfaction of those impulses He himself has deeply
implanted in human nature.</p>
<p>3. The Vow of Obedience. The monks were required to render
absolute obedience to the will of their superiors, as the
representatives of God. Dom Guigo, in his rules for the Carthusian
Order, declares: "Moreover, if the Prior commands one of his
religious to take more food, or to sleep for a longer time, in
fact, whatever command may be given us by our Superior, we are not
allowed to disobey, lest we should disobey God also, who commands
us by the mouth of our Superior. All our practices of mortification
and devotion would be fruitless and of no value, without this one
virtue of obedience, which alone can make them acceptable to
God."</p>
<p>Thus a strict and uncomplaining obedience, not to the laws of
God as interpreted by the individual <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page384"></a>[pg 384]</span> conscience, but to the judgment and
will of a brother man, was demanded of the monks.</p>
<blockquote>"Theirs not to reason why,<br>
Theirs not to make reply,<br>
Theirs but to do and die."</blockquote>
<p>They were often severely beaten or imprisoned and sometimes
mutilated for acts of disobedience. While the monks, especially the
Friars and Jesuits, carried this principle of obedience to great
extremes, yet in the barbarous ages its enforcement was sadly
needed. Law and order were words which the untamed Goth could not
comprehend. He had to be taught habits of obedience, a respect for
the rights of others, and a proper appreciation of his duty to
society for the common good. But while, at the beginning, the
monastic vow of obedience helped to inculcate these desirable
lessons, and vastly modified the ferocity of unchecked
individualism, it tended, in the course of time, to generate a
servile humility fatal to the largest and freest personal
development. In the interests of passive obedience, it suppressed
freedom of thought and action. Obedience became mechanical and
unreasoning. The consequence was that the passion for individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>[pg 385]</span> liberty
was unduly restrained, and the extravagant claims of political and
ecclesiastical tyrants were greatly strengthened.</p>
<p>Such was the monastic ideal and such were some of the means
employed to realize it. The ascetic spirit manifests itself in a
great variety of ways, but all these visible and changing externals
have one common source. "To cherish the religious principle," says
William E. Channing," some have warred against their social
affections, and have led solitary lives; some against their senses,
and have abjured all pleasure in asceticism; some against reason,
and have superstitiously feared to think; some against imagination,
and have foolishly dreaded to read poetry or books of fiction; some
against the political and patriotic principles, and have shrunk
from public affairs,--all apprehending that if they were to give
free range to their natural emotions their religious life would be
chilled or extinguished."</p>

<h2><i><a name="THE_EFFECTS_OF_MONASTICISM"></a>THE EFFECTS OF
MONASTICISM</i></h2>
<br>
<p>"We read history," said Wendell Phillips, "not through our eyes
but through our prejudices." Yet if it were possible entirely to
lay aside one's prepossessions respecting monastic history, it
would still be no easy task to estimate the influences of the monks
upon human life.</p>
<p>In every field of thought and activity monasticism wrought good
and evil. Education, industry, government and religion have been
both furthered and hindered by the monks. What Francis Parkman said
of the Roman Catholic Church is true of the monastic institution:
"Clearly she is of earth, not of heaven; and her transcendently
dramatic life is a type of the good and ill, the baseness and
nobleness, the foulness and purity, the love and hate, the pride,
passion, truth, falsehood, fierceness, and <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span> tenderness, that
battle in the restless heart of man."</p>
<p>A careful and sympathetic survey of monastic history compels the
conclusion that monasticism, while not uniformly a blessing to the
world, was not an unmitigated evil. The system presents one long
series of perplexities and contradictions. One historian shuts his
eyes to its pernicious effects, or at least pardons its
transgressions, on the ground that perfection in man or in
institutions is unattainable. Another condemns the whole system,
believing that the sum of its evils far outweighs whatever benefits
it may have conferred upon mankind. Schaff cuts the Gordian knot,
maintaining that the contradiction is easily solved on the theory
that it was not monasticism, as such, which has proved a blessing
to the Church and the world. "It was Christianity in monasticism,"
he says, "which has done all the good, and used this abnormal mode
of life as a means of carrying forward its mission of love and
peace."</p>
<p>To illustrate the diversities of opinion on this subject, and
incidentally to show how difficult it is to present a
well-balanced, symmetrically fair and just estimate of the monastic
institution as a whole, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page388"></a>[pg 388]</span> contrast the opinions of four
celebrated men. Pius IX. refers to the, monks as "those chosen
phalanxes of the army of Christ which have always been the bulwark
and ornament of the Christian republic as well as of civil
society." But then he was the Pope of Rome, the Arch-prelate of the
Church. "Monk," fiercely demands Voltaire, "Monk, what is that
profession of thine? It is that of having none, of engaging one's
self by an inviolable oath to be a fool and a slave, and to live at
the expense of others." But he was the philosophical skeptic of
Paris. "Where is the town," cries Montalembert, "which has not been
founded or enriched or protected by some religious community? Where
is the church which owes not to them a patron, a relic, a pious and
popular tradition? Wherever there is a luxuriant forest, a pure
stream, a majestic hill, we may be sure that religion has left
there her stamp by the hand of the monk." But this was
Montalembert, the Roman Catholic historian, and the avowed champion
of the monks. "A cruel, unfeeling temper," writes Gibbon, "has
distinguished the monks of every age and country; their stern
indifference, which is seldom mollified by personal <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span> friendship, is
inflamed by religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has
strenuously administered the holy office of the Inquisition." But
this was Gibbon, the hater of everything monastic. Between these
extreme views lies a wide field upon which many a deathless duel
has been fought by the writers of monastic history.</p>
<p>The variety of judgments respecting the nature and effects of
monasticism is partly due to the diversity in the facts of its
history. Monasticism was the friend and the foe of true religion.
It was the inspiration of virtue and the encouragement of vice. It
was the patron of industry and the promoter of idleness. It was a
pioneer in education and the teacher of superstition. It was the
disburser of alms and a many-handed robber. It was the friend of
human liberty and the abettor of tyranny. It was the champion of
the common people and the defender of class privileges. It was, in
short, everything that man was and is, so varied were its
operations, so complex was its influence, so comprehensive was its
life.</p>
<p>Of some things we may be certain. Any religious institution or
ideal of life that has survived the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page390"></a>[pg 390]</span> changes of twelve centuries, and that
has enlisted the enthusiastic services and warmest sympathies of
numerous men and women who have been honorably distinguished for
their intellectual attainments and moral character, must have
possessed elements of truth and moral worth. A contemptuous
treatment of monasticism implies either an ignorance of its real
history or a wilful disregard of the deep significance of its
commendable features.</p>
<p>It is also certain that while the methods of monasticism, judged
by their effects upon the individual and upon society, may be
justly censured, it is beyond question that many monks, groping
their way toward the light in an age of ignorance and superstition,
were inspired by the purest motives. "Conscience," observes
Waddington, "however misguided, cannot be despised by a reflecting
mind. When it leads one to self-sacrifice and moral fortitude we
cannot but admire his spirit, while we condemn his sagacity and
method."</p>

<h2><i><a name=
"The_Effects_of_Self-Sacrifice_Upon_the_Individual"></a>The Effects
of Self-Sacrifice Upon the Individual</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Christianity requires some sort of self-denial as the condition
of true Christian discipleship. Self-love <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>[pg 391]</span> is to yield to a
love of others. In some sense, the Christian is to become dead to
the world and its demoralizing pleasures. But this primal demand
upon the soul needs to be interpreted. What is it to love the
world? What is it to keep the body in subjection? What are harmful
indulgences? To give wrong answers to these questions is to set up
a false ideal; the more strenuously such false ideal is followed,
the more disastrous are the consequences. One's struggle for moral
purity may end in failure, and one's efficiency for good may be
seriously impaired by a perversion of the principle of
self-abnegation. Unnatural severity and excessive abstinence often
produce the opposite effect from that intended. Instead of a
peaceful mind there is delirium, and instead of freedom from
temptation there are a thousand horrible fiends hovering in the air
and ready, at any moment, to pounce upon their prey. "The history
of ascetics," says Martensen, "teaches us that by such overdone
fasting the fancy is often excited to an amazing degree, and in its
airy domain affords the very things that one thought to have
buried, by means of mortification, a magical resurrection." In
attempting to subdue the body, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page392"></a>[pg 392]</span> many necessary requirements of the
physical organism were totally ignored. The body rebelled against
such unnatural treatment, and the mind, so closely related to it,
in its distraction, gave birth to the wildest fancies. Men, who
would have possessed an ordinarily pure mind in some useful
occupation of life, became the prey of the most lewd and obnoxious
imaginations. Then they fancied themselves vile above their
fellows, and laid on more stripes, put more thorns upon their
pillows, and fasted more hours, only to find that instead of
fleeing, the devils became blacker and more numerous.</p>
<p>Self-forgetfulness is the key to happiness. The monk thought
otherwise, and slew himself in his vain attempt to fight against
nature. He never lifted his eyes from his own soul. He was always
feeling his spiritual pulse, staring at his lean spiritual visage,
and tearfully watching his growth in grace. An interest in others
and a strong mind in a strong body are the best antidotes to
religious despair and the temptations of the soul. Life in the
monastery was generally less severe than in the desert's solitude.
There was more and better food, shelter, and comfort, but there
were many unnecessary and unnatural <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page393"></a>[pg 393]</span> restrictions, even in the best days
of monasticism. There were too many hours of prayer, too many
needless regulations for silence, fasting and penance, to produce a
healthy, vigorous type of religious life.</p>

<h2><i><a name=
"The_Effects_of_Solitude_Upon_the_Individual"></a>The Effects of
Solitude Upon the Individual</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p>It has already been shown that some solitude is essential to our
richest culture. Our higher nature demands time for reflection and
meditation. But the monks carried this principle to an extreme, and
they overestimated its benefits. "Ambition, avarice, irresolution,
fear, and inordinate desires," says Montaigne, "do not leave us
because we forsake our native country, they often follow us even to
cloisters and philosophical schools; nor deserts, nor caves, nor
hair shirts, nor fasts, can disengage us from them."</p>
<p>Besides these passions, which the monks carried with them, their
solitary life tended to foster spiritual pride, contract sympathy,
and engender an inhumane spirit. True, there were exceptions; but
the sublime characters which survive in monastic history are by no
means typical of its usual <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page394"></a>[pg 394]</span> effects. Seclusion did not benefit
the average monk. Indeed there is something wanting in even the
loftiest monastic characters. "The heroes of monasticism," says
Allen, "are not the heroes of modern life. All put together, they
would not furnish out one such soul as William of Orange, or
Gustavus, or Milton. Independence of thought and liberty of
conscience, they renounced once for all, in taking upon them the
monastic vow. All the larger enterprises, all the broad humanities,
which to our mind make a greater career, were rigidly shut off by a
barrier that could not be crossed. All the warmth and wealth of
social and domestic life was a field of forbidden fruit, to be
entered only through the gate of unpardonable sin."</p>
<p>Thus self-excluded from a normal life in society, often the
subject of self-inflicted pain, it is no wonder that the monk
impaired all the nobler and manlier feelings of the soul, that he
became strangely indifferent to human affection, that bigotry and
pride often sat as joint rulers on the throne of his heart. He who
had trampled on all filial relations would scarcely recognize the
bonds of human brotherhood. He who heard not the prayer of his own
mother <span class="pagenum"><a name="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span>
would not be likely to listen to the cry of the tortured heretic
for mercy. Man as man was not reverenced. It was the monk in man
who was esteemed. As Milman puts it, "Bigotry has always found its
readiest and sternest executioners among those who have never known
the charities of life."</p>
<p>Nor is it a matter of surprise that the monk was spiritually
proud. He was supposed to stand in the inner circle, a little
nearer the throne of God than his fellow-mortals. When dead, he was
worshiped as a saint and regarded as an intercessor between God and
his lower fellow-creatures. His hatred of the base world easily
passed over into a sense of superiority and ignoble pride.</p>
<p>"True social life," says Martensen, "leads to solitude." This
truth the monks emphasized to the exclusion of the converse, "true
life in solitude leads back to society." John Tauler, the mystic
monk, realized this truth when he said: "If God calls me to a sick
person, or to the service of preaching, or to any other service of
love, I must follow, although I am in the state of highest
contemplation." The hermits of the desert, and too often the monks
of the cloister, escaped from all such services, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>[pg 396]</span> and selfishly gave
themselves up to saving their own souls by contemplation and
prayer. Ministration to the needy is the external side of the inner
religious life. It is the fruit of faith and prayer. The monk
sought solitude, not for the purpose of fitting himself for a place
in society, but for selfish, personal ends. Saint Bruno, in a
letter to his friend Ralph le Verd, eulogizes the solitude of the
monastic cell, and among other sentiments he gives expression to
the following: "I am speaking here of the contemplative life; and
although its sons are less numerous than those of active life, yet,
like Joseph and Benjamin, they are infinitely dearer to their
Father.... O my brother, fear not then to fly from the turmoil and
the misery of the world; leave the storms that rage without, to
shelter yourself in this safe haven."</p>
<p>Thus sinful and sorrowing humanity, needing the guidance and
comfort that holy men can furnish, was forgotten in the desire for
personal peace and future salvation.</p>
<p>Another baneful result of isolation was the strangulation of
filial love. When the monk abandoned the softening, refining
influence of women and children, <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page397"></a>[pg 397]</span> one side of his nature suffered a
serious contraction. An Egyptian mother stood at the hut of two
hermits, her sons. Weeping bitterly, she begged to see their faces.
To her piteous entreaties, they said: "Why do you, who are already
stricken with age, pour forth such cries and lamentations?" "It is
because I long to see you," she replied. "Am I not your mother? I
am now an old and wrinkled woman, and my heart is troubled at the
sound of your voices." But even a mother's love could not cope with
their fearful fanaticism., and she went away with their cold
promise that they would meet in heaven. St. John of Calama visited
his sister in disguise, and a chronicler, telling the story
afterwards, said, "By the mercy of Jesus Christ he had not been
recognized, and they never met again." Many hermits received their
parents or brothers and sisters with their eyes shut. When the
father of Simeon Stylites died, his widowed mother prayed for
entrance into her son's cell. For three days and nights she stood
without, and then the blessed Simeon prayed the Lord for her, and
she immediately gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>These as well as numerous other stories of a similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>[pg 398]</span>
character that might be quoted illustrate the hardening influence
of solitude. Instead of cherishing a love of kindred, as a gift of
heaven and a spring of virtue, the monk spurned it and trampled it
beneath his feet as an obstacle to his spiritual progress. "The
monks," says Milman, "seem almost unconscious of the softening,
humanizing effect of the natural affections, the beauty of parental
tenderness and filial love."</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Monks_as_Missionaries"></a>The Monks as

<br>
<p>The conversion of the barbarians was an indispensable condition
of modern civilization. Every step forward had to be taken in the
face of barbaric ignorance and cruelty. In this stupendous
undertaking the monks led the way, displaying in their labors
remarkable generalship and undaunted courage. Whatever may be
thought of later monasticism, the Benedictine monks are entitled to
the lasting gratitude of mankind for their splendid services in
reducing barbaric Europe to some sort of order and civilization.
But again the mixture of good and evil is strangely illustrated. It
seems <span class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span>
impossible to accord the monks unqualified praise. The potency of
the evil tendencies within their system vitiated every noble
achievement. Their methods and practical ideals were so at variance
with the true order of nature that every commendable victory
involved a corresponding obstacle to real social and religious
progress. The justice of these observations will be more apparent
as this inquiry proceeds.</p>

<h2><i><a name="Monasticism_and_Civic_Duties"></a>Monasticism and
Civic Duties</i></h2>
<br>
<p>The withdrawal of a considerable number of men of character and
talent from the exercise of civic duties is injurious to the state.
The burdens upon those who remain become heavier, while society is
deprived of the moral influence of those who forsake their civic
responsibilities. When the monk, from the outside as it were,
attempted to exert an influence for good, he largely failed. His
ideals of life were not formulated in a real world, but in an
artificial, antisocial environment. He was unable to appreciate the
political needs of men. He could not enter sympathetically into
their serious employments <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page400"></a>[pg 400]</span> or innocent delights. Controlled by
superstition, and exalting a servile obedience to human authority,
he became a very unsafe guide in political affairs. He could not
consistently labor for secular progress, because he had forsaken a
world in which secular interests were prominent.</p>
<p>It may be true that in the early days of monasticism the monks
pursued the proper course in refusing to become Roman patriots. No
human power could have averted the ruin which overtook that corrupt
world. Perhaps their non-combatant attitude gave them more
influence with the conquerors of Rome, who were to become the
founders of modern nations.</p>
<p>In later years, the abbots of the principal monasteries occupied
seats in the legislative assemblies of Germany, Hungary, Spain,
England, Italy, and France. In many instances they stood between
the violence of the nobles and the unprotected vassal. Political
monks, inspired by a natural breadth of vision and a love of
humanity, secured the passage of wise and humane regulations.
Palgrave says: "The mitre has resisted many blows which would have
broken the helmet, and the crosier has kept <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page401"></a>[pg 401]</span> more foes in awe
than the lance. It is, then, to these prelates that we chiefly owe
the maintenance of the form and spirit of free government, secured
to us, not by force, but by law; and the altar has thus been the
corner-stone of our ancient constitution."</p>
<p>Although there is much truth in the foregoing observation, yet
on the other hand, when the influence of the monastic ideal upon
civilization is studied in its deeper aspects, it cannot be justly
maintained that the final effects of monasticism minister to the
development of a normal civilization. Industrial, mental and moral
progress depend upon a certain breadth of mind and energy of soul.
Asceticism saps the vitality of human nature and confines the
activity of the mind within artificial limits. "Hence the dreary,
sterile torpor," says Lecky, "that characterized those ages in
which the ascetic principle has been supreme, while the
civilizations which have attained the highest perfection have been
those of ancient Greece and modern Europe, which were most opposed
to it."</p>
<p>The monks did not hesitate to become embroiled in military
quarrels, or to incite the fiercer passions of men when it suited
their purpose. Their opposition <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page402"></a>[pg 402]</span> to kings and princes was often not
based on a love of popular freedom, but on an indisposition to
share power with secular rulers. The legislative enactments against
heretics, many of which they inspired, clearly show that they
neither desired nor tolerated liberty of speech or conduct. They
were the Almighty's vicars on earth, before whom it was the duty of
king and subject to bow down. Vaughan writes of the period just
prior to the Reformation: "The great want was freedom from
ecclesiastical domination; and from the feeling of the hour,
scarcely any price would be deemed too great to be paid for that
object." The history of modern Jesuitism, against which the
legislation of almost every civilized nation has been directed,
affords abundant testimony to the inherent hostility of the
monastic system, even in its modified modern form, to every species
of government which in any way guarantees freedom of thought to its
people. This stern fact confronts the student, however much he may
be inclined to yield homage to the early monks. It must be held in
mind when one reads this pleasing sentence from Macaulay: "Surely a
system which, however deformed by superstition, introduced strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span> moral
restraints into communities previously governed only by vigor of
muscle and by audacity of spirit, a system which taught the
fiercest and mightiest ruler that he was, like his meanest bondman,
a responsible being, might have seemed to deserve a more respectful
mention from philosophers and philanthropists."</p>
<p>The general effect of monasticism on the state is, therefore,
not to be determined by fixing the gaze on any one century of its
history, or by holding up some humane and patriotic monk as a
representative product of the system.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Agricultural_Services_of_the_Monks"></a>The
Agricultural Services of the Monks</i></h2>
<br>
<p>Europe must ever be indebted to Benedict and his immediate
followers for their services in reclaiming waste lands, and in
removing the stigma which a corrupt civilization had placed upon
labor. Benedict came before the world saying: "No person is ever
more usefully employed than when working with his hands or
following the plough, providing food for the use of man." Care was
taken that councils should not be called when ploughing was to be
done <span class="pagenum"><a name="page404"></a>[pg 404]</span> or
wheat to be threshed. Benedict bent himself to the task of teaching
the rich and the proud, the poor and the lazy the alphabet of
prosperity and happiness. Agriculture was at its lowest ebb.
Marshes covered once fertile fields, and the men who should have
tilled the land spurned the plough as degrading, or were too
indolent to undertake the tasks of the farm. The monks left their
cells and their prayers to dig ditches and plough fields. The
effect was magical. Men once more turned back to a noble but
despised industry. Peace and plenty supplanted war and poverty.
"The Benedictines," says Guizot, "have been the great clearers of
land in Europe. A colony, a little swarm of monks, settled in
places nearly uncultivated, often in the midst of a pagan
population--in Germany, for example, or in Brittany; there, at once
missionaries and laborers, they accomplish their double service,
through peril and fatigue."</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that history throws a shadow across this
pleasing scene. When labor came to be recognized as honorable and
useful, along came the begging friars, creating, both by precept
and example, a prejudice against labor and wealth. Rags and
laziness <span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>[pg
405]</span> came to be associated with holiness, and a beggar monk
was held up as an ideal and sacred personage. "The spirit that
makes men devote themselves in vast numbers," says Lecky, "to a
monotonous life of asceticism and poverty is so essentially opposed
to the spirit that creates the energy and enthusiasm of industry,
that their continued coexistence may be regarded as impossible."
But such a fatal mistake could not long captivate the mind, or
cause men to forget Benedict and his industrial ideal. The
blessings of wealth rightly administered, and the dignity of labor
without which wealth is impossible, came to be recognized as
necessary factors in the true progress of man.</p>

<h2><i><a name="The_Monks_and_Secular_Learning"></a>The Monks and
Secular Learning</i></h2>
<br>
<p>For many centuries, as has been previously shown, the monks were
the schoolmasters of Europe. They also preserved the manuscripts of
the classics, produced numerous theological works, transmitted many
pious traditions, and wrote some interesting and some worthless
chronicles. They laid the foundations of several great
universities, including those <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page406"></a>[pg 406]</span> of Paris, Oxford and Cambridge. For
these, and other valuable services, the monks merit the praise of
posterity. It is, however, too much to affirm, as Montalembert
does, that "without the monks, we should have been as ignorant of
our history as children." It is altogether improbable that the
human mind would have been unproductive in the field of historical
writing had monasticism not existed during the middle ages. While,
also, the monks should be thanked for preserving the classics, it
should not be supposed that all knowledge of Latin and Greek
literature would have perished but for them.</p>
<p>It is surprising that the literary men of the medieval period
should have written so little of interest to the modern mind, or
that helps us to an understanding of the momentous events amid
which they lived. Unfortunately the monkish mind was concentrated
upon a theology, the premises of which have been largely set aside
by modern science. Their writings are so permeated by grotesque
superstitions that they are practically worthless to-day. Their
hostility to secular affairs blinded them to the tremendous
significance of the mighty political and social movements of the
age.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407"></a>[pg 407]</span>
<p>It is undeniable that the monks never encouraged a love of
secular learning. They did not try to impart a love of the classics
which they preserved. The spirit of monasticism was ever at war
with true intellectual progress. The monks imprisoned Roger Bacon
fourteen years, and tried to blast his fair name by calling him a
magician, merely because he stepped beyond the narrow limits of
monkish inquiry. Many suffered indignities, privations or death for
questioning tradition or for conducting scientific researches.</p>
<p>So while it is true that the monks rendered many services to the
cause of education, it is also true that their monastic theories
tended to narrow the scope of intellectual activity. "This," says
Guizot, "is the foundation of their instruction; all was turned
into commentary of the Scriptures, historical, philosophical,
allegorical, moral commentary. They desired only to form priests;
all studies, whatsoever their nature, were directed to this
result." There was no disinterested love of learning; no desire to
become acquainted with God's world. In fact, the old hostility to
everything natural characterizes all monastic history. Europe did
not enter upon that broad and noble intellectual development
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408"></a>[pg 408]</span> which
is the glory of our era, until the right arm of monasticism was
struck down, the dread of heresy banished from the human mind, and
secular learning welcomed as a legitimate and elevated field for
mental activity.</p>
<p>Hamilton W. Mabie, in his delightful essay on "Some Old
Scholars," describes this step from the gloom of the cloister to
the light of God's world: "Petrarch really escaped from a sepulcher
when he stepped out of the cloister of medievalism, with its
crucifix, its pictures of unhealthy saints, its cords of
self-flagellation, and found the heavens clear, beautiful, and well
worth living under, and the world full of good things which one
might desire and yet not be given over to evil. He ventured to look
at life for himself and found it full of wonderful dignity and
power. He opened his Virgil, brushed aside the cobwebs which
monkish brains had spun over the beautiful lines, and met the old
poet as one man meets another; and lo! there arose before him a
new, untrodden and wholly human world, free from priestcraft and
pedantry, near to nature and unspeakably alluring and
satisfying."</p>
<p>The Dominicans and Jesuits set their faces like <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page409"></a>[pg 409]</span> flint against all
education tending to liberalize the mind. Here is a passage from a
document published by the Jesuits at their first centenary: "It is
undeniable that we have undertaken a great and uninterrupted war in
the interests of the Catholic church against heresy. Heresy need
never hope that the society will make terms with it, or remain
quiescent ... No peace need be expected, for the seed of hatred is
born within us. What Hamilcar was to Hannibal, Ignatius is to us.
At his instigation, we have sworn upon the altars eternal war."
When this proclamation is read in the light of history, its meaning
stands forth with startling clearness. Almost every truth in
science and philosophy, no matter how valuable it was destined to
become as an agent in enhancing the well-being of the race, has had
to wear the stigma of heresy.</p>
<p>It is an interesting speculation to imagine what the
intellectual development of Europe would have been, had secular
learning been commended by the monks, and the common people
encouraged to exercise their minds without fear of excommunication
or death. It is sad to reflect how many great thoughts must have
perished still-born in the student's cloister <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page410"></a>[pg 410]</span> cell, and to
picture the silent grief with which many a brilliant soul must have
repressed his eager imagination.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="The_Charity_of_the_Monks"></a>The Charity of the
Monks</i></h2>
<br>
<p>In the eleventh century, a monk named Thieffroy wrote the
following: "It matters little that our churches rise to heaven,
that the capitals of their pillars are sculptured and gilded, that
our parchment is tinted purple, that gold is melted to form the
letters of our manuscripts, and that their bindings are set with
precious stones, if we have little or no care for the members of
Christ, and if Christ himself lies naked and dying before our
doors." This spirit, so charmingly expressed, was never quite
absent from the monkish orders. The monasteries were asylums for
the hungry during famines, and the sick during plagues. They served
as hotels where the traveler found a cordial welcome, comfortable
shelter and plain food. If he needed medical aid, his wants were
supplied. During the black plague, while many monks fled with the
multitude, others stayed at their posts and were to be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411"></a>[pg 411]</span> daily
in the homes of the stricken, ministering to their bodily and
spiritual needs. Many of them perished in their heroic and
self-sacrificing labors.</p>
<p>Alms-giving was universally enjoined as a sure passport to
heaven. The most glittering rewards were held out to those who
enriched the monks with legacies to be used in relief of the poor.
It was, no doubt, the unselfish activities of the monks that caused
them to be held in such high esteem; the result was their coffers
were filled with more gold than they could easily give away. Thus
abuses grew up. Bernard said: "Piety gave birth to wealth, and the
daughter devoured the mother." Jacob of Vitry complained that
money, "by various and deceptive tricks," was exacted from the
people by the monks, most of which adhered "to their unfaithful
fingers." While Lecky eloquently praises the monks for their
beautiful deeds of charity, "following all the windings of the poor
man's grief," still he condones in the strongest terms the action
of Henry VIII. in transferring the monastic funds to his own
treasury: "No misapplication of this property by private persons
could produce as much evil as an unrestrained monasticism."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412"></a>[pg 412]</span>
<p>It would be unjust, however, to censure the monks for not
recognizing the evil social effects of indiscriminate alms-giving.
While their system was imperfect, it was the only one possible in
an age when the social sciences were unknown. It is difficult, even
to-day, to restrain that good-natured, but baneful, benevolence
which takes no account of circumstances and consequences, and often
fosters the growth of pauperism. The monks kept alive that sweet
spirit of philanthropy which is so essential to all the higher
forms of civilization. It is easier to discover the proper methods
for the exercise of generous sentiments, than to create those
feelings or to arouse them when dormant.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 35%;">
<br>
<br>
<h2><i><a name="Monasticism_and_Religion"></a>Monasticism and
Religion</i></h2>
<br>
<p>No doctrine in theology, or practice of religion, has been free
from monastic influences. An adequate treatment of this theme would
require volumes instead of paragraphs. A few points, however, may
be touched upon by way of suggestion to those who may wish to
pursue the subject further.</p>
<p>The effect of the monastic ideal was to emphasize <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span> the sinfulness of
man and his need of redemption. To get rid of sin--that is the
problem of humanity. A quaint formula of monastic confession reads:
"I confess all the sins of my body, of my flesh, of my bones and
sinews, of my veins and cartilages, of my tongue and lips, of my
ears, teeth and hair, of my marrow and any other part whatsoever,
whether it be soft or hard, wet or dry." This emphasis on man's
sinfulness and the need of redemption was sadly needed in Rome and
all down the ages. "It was a protest," says Clarke, "against
pleasure as the end of life ... It proved the reality of the
religious sentiment to a skeptical age.... If this long period of
self-torture has left us no other gain, let us value it as a proof
that in man religious aspiration is innate, unconquerable, and able
to triumph over all that the world hopes and over all that it
fears."</p>
<p>Thus the monks helped to keep alive the enthusiasm of religion.
There was a fervor, a devotion, a spirit of sacrifice, in the
system, which acted as a corrective to the selfish materialism of
the early and middle ages. Christian history furnishes many sad
spectacles of brutality and licentiousness, of insolent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span> pride
and uncontrolled greed, masked in the garb of religion.
Monasticism, by its constant insistence upon poverty and obedience,
fostered a spirit of loyalty to Christ and the cross, which served
as a protest, not only against the general laxity of morals, but
also against the faithlessness of corrupt monks. Harnack says: "It
was always monasticism that rescued the church when sinking, freed
her when secularized, defended her when attacked. It warmed hearts
that were growing cold, restrained unruly spirits, won back the
people when alienated from the church." It may have been in harmony
with divine plans, that religion was to have been kept alive and
vigorous by excessive austerities, even as in later days it needed
the stern and unyielding Puritan spirit, now regarded as too grim
and severe, to cope successfully with the forces of tyranny and
sin.</p>
<p>If it be true, as some are inclined to believe, that this age is
losing a definite consciousness of sin, that in the reaction from
the asceticism of the monks and the gloom of the Puritans we are in
danger of minimizing the doctrine of personal accountability to
God, then we cannot afford to ignore the underlying ideal of
monasticism. In so far as monasticism contributed <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span> to a normal
consciousness of human freedom and personal guilt, and maintained a
grip upon the conscience of the sinner, it has rendered the cause
of true religion a genuine and permanent service.</p>
<p>But the mistake of the monks was twofold. They exaggerated sin,
and they employed unhealthy methods to get rid of it. Excessive
introspection, instead of exercising a purifying influence, tends
to distort one's religious conceptions, and creates an unwholesome
type of piety. Man is a sinner, but he also has potential and
actual goodness. The monks failed to define sin in accordance with
facts. Many innocent pleasures and legitimate satisfactions were
erroneously thought to be sinful. Honorable and useful aspirations
that, under wise control, minister to man's highest development
were selected for eradication. "Every instinct of human nature,"
says W.E. Channing, "has its destined purpose in life, and the
perfect man is to be found in the proportionate cultivation of each
element of his character, not in the exaggerated development of
those faculties which are deemed primarily good, nor in the
repression of those which are evil only when their prominence
destroys the balance of the whole."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416"></a>[pg 416]</span>
<p>But the methods employed by the monks to get rid of sin afford
another illustration of the fact that noble sentiments and holy
aspirations need to be wisely directed. It is not enough for a
mother to love her child; she must know how to give that love
proper expression. In her attempt to guide and train her loved one
she may fatally mislead him. The modern emphasis upon method
deserves wider recognition than it has received.</p>
<p>The applause of the church that sounded so sweet in the ears of
the monk, as he laid the stripes upon his body, proclaims the high
esteem in which penance was held. But the monk cruelly deceived
himself. His self-inflicted tortures developed within his soul an
unnatural piety, "a piety," says White, "that became visionary and
introspective, a theology of black clouds and lightning and
thunder, a superstitious religion based on dreams and saint's
bones." True penitence consists in high and holy purposes, in pure
and unselfish living, and not in disfigurements and in misery.
Dreariness and fear are not the proper manifestations of that
perfect love which casteth out fear.</p>
<p>The influence of monasticism upon the doctrine <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page417"></a>[pg 417]</span> of atonement for
sin was, in many respects, prejudicial to the best interests of
religion. The monks are largely responsible for the theory that sin
can be atoned for by pecuniary gifts. It may be said that they did
not ignore true feelings of repentance, of which the gold was
merely a tangible expression, but the notion widely prevailed that
the prayers of the monks, purchased by temporal gifts, secured the
forgiveness of the transgressor. The worship of saints, pilgrimages
to shrines, and reverence for bones and other relics, were
assiduously encouraged.</p>
<p>Thus the monkish conception of salvation and of the means by
which it is to be obtained were at variance with any reasonable
interpretation of the Scriptures and the dictates of human reason.
"It measured virtue," says Schaff, "by the quantity of outward
exercises, instead of the quality of the inward disposition, and
disseminated self-righteousness and an anxious, legal, and
mechanical religion[<a href="#NOTE_K">K</a>]."</p>
<p>The doctrine of future punishment reached its most repulsive and
abnormal developments in the hands of the monks. A vast literature
was produced by them, portraying, with vivid minuteness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span> the
pangs of hell. Volcanoes were said to be the portals of the lower
world, that heaved and sighed as human souls were plunged into the
awful depths. God was held up as a fearful judge, and the saving
mercy of Christ himself paled before the rescuing power of his
mother. These fearful caricatures of God, these detailed, revolting
descriptions of pain and anguish, could not but have a hardening
effect upon the minds of men. "To those," says Lecky, "who do not
regard these teachings as true, it must appear without exception,
the most odious in the religious history of the world, subversive
of the very foundations of Christianity."</p>
<p>Finally, the greatest error of monastic teaching was in its
false and baneful distinction between the secular and the
religious. Unquestionably the Christian ideal is founded on some
form of world-renunciation. The teachings and example of Jesus, the
lives of the Apostles, and the characters of the early Christians,
exhibit in varying phases the ideal of self-crucifixion. The
doctrine of the cross, with all that it signifies, is the most
powerful force in the spread of Christianity. The spiritual nature
of man needs to be trained and disciplined. But does <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span> this truth lead the
Christian to the monastic method? Was the self-renunciation of
Jesus like that of the ascetics, with their ecstasies and
self-punishments? Is God more pleased with the recluse who turns
from a needy world to shut himself up to prayer and meditation,
than He is with him who cultivates holy emotions and heavenly
aspirations, while pursuing some honorable and useful calling? The
answer to these questions discloses the chief fallacy in the
monastic ideal, the effect of which was the creation of an
artificial piety. There is no special virtue in silence, celibacy,
and abstinence from the enjoyment of God's gifts to mankind.</p>
<p>The crying need of Christianity to-day is a willingness on the
part of Christ's followers to live for others instead of self. Men
and women are needed who, like many of the monks and nuns, will
identify themselves with the toiling multitudes, and who will
forego the pleasures of the world and the prospects of material
gain or social preferment, for the sake of ministering to a needy
humanity. The essence of Christianity is a love to God and man that
expresses itself in terms of social service and self-sacrifice.
Monasticism helped to preserve that noble <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span> essence of all true
religion. But a revival of the apostolic spirit in these times
would not mean a triumph for monasticism. Stripped of its rigid
vows of celibacy, poverty and obedience, monasticism is dead.</p>
<p>The spirit of social service, the insistence upon soul-purity,
and the craving for participation in the divine nature, are the
fruits of Christianity, not of monasticism, which merely sought to
carry out the Christian ideal. But it is not necessary, in order to
realize this ideal, to wage war on human nature. True Christianity
is perfectly compatible with wealth, health and social joys. The
realms of industry, politics and home-life are a part of God's
world. A religious ideal based on a distorted view of social life,
that involves a renunciation of human joy and the extinction of
natural desires, and that prohibits the free exercise of beneficent
faculties, as conditions of its realization, can never establish
its right to permanent and universal dominion. The faithful
discharge of unromantic, secular duties, the keeping of one's heart
pure in the midst of temptation, and the unheralded altruism of
private life, must ever be as welcome in the sight of God as the
prayers of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page421"></a>[pg
421]</span> the recluse, who scorns the world of secular
affairs.</p>
<p>True religion, the highest religion, is possible beyond the
walls of churches and convents. The so-called secular employments
of business and politics, of home and school, may be conducted in a
spirit of lofty consecration to the Eternal, and so carried on,
may, in their way, minister to the highest welfare of humanity. The
old distinction, therefore, between the secular and the sacred is
pernicious and false. There are some other sacred things besides
monasteries and prayers. Human life itself is holy; so are the
commonplace duties of the untitled household and factory
saints.</p>
<blockquote>"God is in all that liberates and lifts,<br>
In all that humbles, sweetens, and consoles."</blockquote>
<p>Modern monasticism has forsaken the column of St. Simeon
Stylites and the rags of St. Francis. It has given up the ancient
and fantastic feats of asceticism, and the spiritual extravagances
of the early monks. The old monasticism never could have arisen
under a religious system controlled by natural and healthful
spiritual ideas. It has no attractions for minds unclouded by
superstition. It has lost <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page422"></a>[pg 422]</span> its hold upon the modern man because
the ancient ideas of God and his world, upon which it thrived, have
passed away.</p>
<p>Such are some of the effects of the monastic institution. Its
history is at once a warning and an inspiration. Its dreamy
asceticism, its gloomy cells, are gone. Its unworldly motives, its
stern allegiance to duty, its protest against self-indulgence, its
courage and sincerity, will ever constitute the potent energy of
true religion. Its ministrations to the broken-hearted, and its
loving care of the poor, must ever remain as a shining example of
practical Christianity. In the simplicity of the monk's life, in
the idea of "brotherhood," in the common life for common ends, a
Christian democracy will always find food for reflection. As the
social experiments of modern times reveal the hidden laws of social
and religious progress, it will be found that in spite of its
glaring deficiencies, monasticism was a magnificent attempt to
realize the ideal of Christ in individual and social life. As such
it merits neither ridicule nor obloquy. It was a <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span> heroic struggle
with inveterate ignorance and sin, the history of which flashes
many a welcome light upon the problems of modern democracy and
religion.</p>
<p>Monastic forms and vows may pass away with other systems that
will have their day, but its fervor of faith, and its warfare
against human passion and human greed, its child-like love of the
heavenly kingdom will never die. The revolt against its
superstitions and excesses is justifiable only in a society that
seeks to actualize its underlying religious ideal of personal
purity and social service.</p>

<h3><a name="NOTE_A"></a>NOTE A</h3>
<br>
<p>The derivation and meaning of a few monastic terms may be of
interest to the reader.</p>
<p>Abbot, from [Greek: abba], literally, father. A title originally
given to any monk, but afterwards restricted to the head or
superior of a monastery.</p>
<p>Anchoret, anchorite, from the Greek, [Greek:
anachor&ecirc;t&ecirc;s], a recluse, literally, one retired. In the
classification of religious ascetics, the anchorets were those who
were most excessive in their austerities, not only choosing
solitude but subjecting themselves to the greatest privations.</p>
<p>Ascetic, [Greek: ask&ecirc;t&ecirc;s], one who exercises, an
athlete. The term was first applied to those practicing self-denial
for athletic purposes. In its ecclesiastical sense, it denotes
those who seek holiness through self-mortification.</p>
<p>Canon Regular. About A.D. 755, Chrodegangus, Bishop of Metz,
gave a cloister-life law to his clergy, who came to be called
canons, from [Greek: kan&ocirc;n], rule. The canons were originally
priests living in a community like monks, and acting as assistants
to the bishops. They gradually formed separate and independent
bodies. Benedict XII. (1399) tried to secure a general adoption of
the rule of Augustine for these canons, which gave rise to the
distinction between canons regular (i.e., those who follow that
rule), and canons secular (those who do not).</p>
<p>Cenobite, from the Greek, [Greek: koinos], common, and [Greek:
bios], life; applied to those living in monasteries.</p>
<p>Clerks Regular. This is a title given to certain religious
orders founded in the sixteenth century. The principal societies
are: the Theatines, founded by Cajetan of Thiene, subsequently Pope
Paul <span class="pagenum"><a name="page426"></a>[pg 426]</span>
IV.; and Priests of the Oratory, instituted by Philip Neri, of
Florence. These two orders have been held in high repute, numbering
among their members many men of rank and intellect.</p>
<p>Cloister, from the Latin, <i>Claustra</i>, that which closes or
shuts, an inclosure; hence, a place of religious retirement, a
monastery.</p>
<p>Hermit, or eremite, from the Greek, [Greek: her&ecirc;mos],
desolate, solitary. One who dwells alone apart from society, or
with but few companions. Not used of those who dwell in
cloisters.</p>
<p>Monastery, comes from the same source as monk. Commonly applied
to a house used exclusively by monks. The term, however, strictly
includes the abbey, the priory, the nunnery, the friary, and in
this broad sense is synonymous with convent, which is from the
Latin, <i>convenire</i>, to meet together.</p>
<p>Monk, from the Greek, [Greek: mhonos], alone, single.
Originally, a man who retired from the world for religious
meditation. In later use, a member of a community. It is used
indiscriminately to denote all persons in monastic orders, in or
out of the monasteries.</p>
<p>Nun, from <i>nouna</i>, i.e., chaste, holy. "The word is
probably of Coptic origin, and occurs as early as in Jerome."
(Schaff).</p>
<p>Regulars. Until the tenth century it was not customary to regard
the monks as a part of the clerical order. Before that time they
were known as <i>religiosi</i> or <i>regulares</i>. Afterwards a
distinction was made between parish priests, or secular clergy, and
the monks, or regular clergy.</p>
<p>For more detailed information on these and other monastic words,
see The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia, and McClintock and
Strong's Encyclopedia.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_B"></a>NOTE B</h3>
<p>The Pythagoreans are likened to the Jesuits probably on account
of their submission to Pythagoras as Master, their love of learning
and their austerities. Like the Jesuits, the Pythagorean league
entangled itself with politics and became the object of hatred and
violence. Its <span class="pagenum"><a name="page427"></a>[pg
427]</span> meeting-houses were everywhere sacked and burned. As a
philosophical school Pythagoreanism became extinct about the middle
of the fourth century.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_C"></a>NOTE C</h3>
<p>The Encyclop&aelig;dia Brittanica divides the monastic
institutions into five classes:</p>
<p>1. Monks. 2. Canons Regular. 3. Military Orders. 4. Friars. 5.
Clerks Regular. All of these have communities of women, either
actually affiliated to them, or formed on similar lines.</p>
<p>Saint Benedict distinguishes four sorts of monks: 1. Coenobites,
living under an abbot in a monastery. 2. Anchorites, who retire
into the desert. 3. Sarabaites, dwelling two or three in the same
cell. 4. Gyrovagi, who wander from monastery to monastery. The last
two kinds he condemns. The Gyrovagi or wandering monks were the
pest of convents and the disgrace of monasticism. They evaded all
responsibilities and spent their time tramping from place to place,
living like parasites, and spreading vice and disorder wherever
they went.</p>
<p>There were really four distinct stages in the development of the
monastic institution:</p>
<p>1. Asceticism. Clergy and laymen practiced various forms of
self-denial without becoming actual monks.</p>
<p>2. The hermit life, which was asceticism pushed to an external
separation from the world. Here are to be found anchorites, and
stylites or pillar-saints.</p>
<p>3. Coenobitism, or monastic life proper, consisting of
associations of monks under one roof, and ruled by an abbot.</p>
<p>4. Monastic orders, or unions of cloisters, the various abbots
being under the authority of one supreme head, who was, at first,
generally the founder of the brotherhood.</p>
<p>Under this last division are to be classed the Mendicant Friars,
the Military Monks, the Jesuits and other modern organizations. The
members of these orders commenced their monastic life in
monasteries, and were therefore coenobites, but many of them passed
out of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page428"></a>[pg
428]</span> cloister to become teachers, preachers or missionary
workers in various fields.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_D"></a>NOTE D</h3>
<p>Matins. One of the canonical hours appointed in the early
church, and still observed in the Roman Catholic Church, especially
in monastic orders. It properly begins at midnight. The name is
also applied to the service itself, which includes the Lord's
Prayer, the Angelic Salutation, the Creed and several psalms.</p>
<p>Lauds, a religious service in connection with matins; so called
from the reiterated ascriptions of praise to God in the psalms.</p>
<p>Prime. The first hour or period of the day; follows after matins
and lauds; originally intended to be said at the first hour after
sunrise.</p>
<p>Tierce, terce. The third hour; half-way between sunrise and
noon.</p>
<p>Sext. The sixth hour, originally and properly said at
midday.</p>
<p>None, noon. The ninth hour from sunrise, or the middle hour
between midday and sunset--that is, about 3 o'clock.</p>
<p>Vespers, the next to the last of the canonical hours--the
even-song.</p>
<p>Compline. The last of the seven canonical hours, originally said
after the evening meal and before retiring to sleep, but in later
medieval and modern usage following immediately on vespers.</p>
<p>B.V.M.--Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_E"></a>NOTE E</h3>
<p>The literary and educational services of the monks are described
in many histories, but the reader will find the best treatment of
this subject in the scholarly yet popular work of George Haven
Putnam, "Books and Their Makers During the Middle Ages," to which
we are largely indebted for the facts given in this volume.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_F"></a>NOTE F</h3>
<p>In many interesting particulars St. Francis may be compared with
General Booth of the Salvation Army. In their intense religious
fervor, in their insistence upon obedience, humility, and
self-denial, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page429"></a>[pg
429]</span> their services for the welfare of the poor, in their
love of the "submerged tenth," they are alike. True, there are no
monkish vows in the Salvation Army and its doctrines bear a general
resemblance to those of other Protestant communions, but like the
old Franciscan order, it is dominated by a powerful missionary
spirit, and its members are actuated by an unsurpassed devotion to
the common people. In the autocratic, military features of the
Army, it more nearly approaches the ideal of Loyola. It is quite
possible that the differences between Francis and Booth are due
more to the altered historical environment than to any radical
diversities in the characters of the two men.</p>

<p>The quotations from Father Sherman are taken from an address
delivered by him in Central Music Hall, Chicago, Illinois, on
Monday, February 5, 1894, in which he extolled the virtues of
Loyola and defended the aims and character of the Society of
Jesus.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_H"></a>NOTE H</h3>
<p>Those who may wish to study the casuistry of the Jesuits, as it
appears in their own works, are referred to two of the most
important and comparatively late authorities: Liguori's
"<i>Theologia Moralis</i>," and Gury's "<i>Compendium Theologioe
Moralis</i>" and "<i>Casus Conscienti&aelig;</i>." Gury was
Professor of Moral Theology in the College Romain, the Jesuits'
College in Rome. His works have passed through several editions.
They were translated from the Latin into French by Paul Bert,
member of the Chamber of Deputies. An English translation of the
French rendering was published by B.F. Bradbury, of Boston,
Massachusetts. The reader is also referred to Pascal's "Provincial
Letters" and to Migne's "<i>Dictionnaire de cas de
Conscience</i>."</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_I"></a>NOTE I</h3>
<p>The student may profitably study the life and teachings of
Wyclif in their bearing upon the destruction of the monasteries.
Wyclif was <span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>[pg
430]</span> designated as the "Gospel Doctor" because he maintained
that "the law of Jesus Christ infinitely exceeds all other laws."
He held to the right of private judgment in the interpretation of
Scripture, and denied the infallibility claimed by the pontiffs. He
opposed pilgrimages, held loosely to image-worship and rejected the
system of tithing as it was then carried on. Wyclif was also a
persistent and public foe of the mendicant friars. The views of
this eminent reformer were courageously advocated by his followers,
and for nearly two generations they continued to agitate the
English people. It is easy to understand, therefore, how Wyclif's
opinions assisted in preparing the nation for the Reformation of
the sixteenth century, although it seemed that Lollardy had been
everywhere crushed by persecution. The Lollards condemned, among
other things, pilgrimages to the tombs of the saints, papal
authority and the mass. Their revolt against Rome led in some
instances to grave excesses.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_J"></a>NOTE J</h3>
<p>In France, the religious houses suppressed by the laws of
February 13, 1790, and August 18, 1792, amounted (without reckoning
various minor establishments) to 820 abbeys of men and 255 of
women, with aggregate revenues of 95,000,000 livres.</p>
<p>The Thirty Years' War in Germany wrought much mischief to the
monasteries. On the death of Maria Theresa, in 1780, Joseph II.,
her son, dissolved the Mendicant Orders and suppressed the greater
number of monasteries and convents in his dominions.</p>
<p>Although Pope Alexander VII. secured the suppression of many
small cloisters in Italy, he was in favor of a still wider
abolition on account of the superfluity of religious institutes,
and the general degeneration of the monks. Various minor
suppressions had taken place in Italy, but it was not until the
unification of the kingdom that the religious houses were declared
national property. The total number of monasteries suppressed in
Italy, down to 1882, was 2,255, involving an enormous displacement
of property and dispersion of inmates.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page431"></a>[pg 431]</span>
<p>The fall of the religious houses in Spain dates from the law of
June 21, 1835, which suppressed nine hundred monasteries at a blow.
The remainder were dissolved on October 11th, in the same year.</p>
<p>No European country had so many religious houses in proportion
to its population and area as Portugal. In 1834 the number
suppressed exceeded 500.</p>
<br>
<h3><a name="NOTE_K"></a>NOTE K</h3>
<p>The criticism of Schaff is just in its estimate of the general
influence of the monastic ideal, but there were individual monks
whose views of sin and salvation were singularly pure and
elevating. Saint Hugh, of Lincoln, said to several men of the world
who were praising the lives of the Carthusian monks: "Do not
imagine that the kingdom of Heaven is only for monks and hermits.
When God will judge each one of us, he will not reproach the lost
for not having been monks or solitaries, but for not having been
true Christians. Now, to be a true Christian, three things are
necessary; and if one of these three things is wanting to us, we
are Christians only in name, and our sentence will be all the more
severe, the more we have made profession of perfection. The three
things are: <i>Charity in the heart, truth on the lips, and purity
of life</i>; if we are wanting in these, we are unworthy of the
name of Christian."</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
